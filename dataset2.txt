greatest example

laughing
the original ps1 game pepsi man
one of the first fully branded
video games of all time

beaten in two hours

stream that is my goal
that is my mission now if you haven't
seen my review of pepsi man please watch
the old ad review youtube video
we're gonna unlock the secrets the story
the mystery of pepsi man
hey let's start the game
by the way i've never played this i
don't know i have no idea what i'm
getting into
oh pepsi man you got here just at the
perfect time
i gotta call it a vending machine ahead
ran out of pepsi
and i was like no over there but i got a
flat tire
there are a bunch of people gathered in
front of the vending machine
no pepsi this is a tragedy
voice acting top tier
here we go baby here we go
okay my movement mesh movement yes
oh my oh my god god gamer hard at work
god especially one of delicious ice cold
pepsi for some reason
for some reason only the refreshing
taste of pepsi will do
one has to ask themselves why is pepsi
man so comfortable with home invasion
normally i wouldn't want a man in a
weird strange mask
running through my living room this is
uh by the way
running entirely on the rtx 3090.
scene one complete there's only six
scenes but apparently it gets hard
oh god the classic american pastor of
jackhammer jumping
[ __ ] i got too green for the pepsi i got
too greedy for the pepsi what do you
want me to say dude
i absolutely crave that delicious taste
into this house i must go
to steal your pepsi
oh it's our skateboard there's nothing
cooler than that
it's san francisco in the 90s
yes wow
jesus hundreds dead as giant pepsi oh
[ __ ]
this is so much damage pepsi
you didn't think this through
pepsi coke doesn't do this
it should have been a coke can it makes
no sense for pepsi do much damage
pepsi is a good company
story time story time you're doing
pretty good this is pepsi
this is how japan sees america
oh we love that sound fireman what do
you need
there's a building on fire just ahead we
need to get there immediately but look
what's happened
according to reports i have heard they
got the fire under control
but there are some people that couldn't
escape fast enough and are trapped on
the roof
they are extremely exhausted and it
doesn't seem likely that we can get
first aid to them
in time sorry i have to pause
this this is a serious problem
this is human beings trapped in a fire
needing first aid pepsi man's whole
shtick
is that he goes to vending machines that
are empty
and fills them up so you can get more
pepsi these people do not need
pepsi pepsi man your antics will only
complicate
situation please stay far away let the
firemen do their job
they do not need pepsi dude
can't you give them something to help
revive them pepsi man
they need it they need medical
assistance yo this is literally this is
capitalism dude
this is american healthcare this is our
solution
oh they need help with all their health
issues
if always something could revive them
out the refreshing taste of pepsi
oh my god it's a hellscape
this city has gone to absolute [ __ ] does
no one notice maybe because we keep out
farming out government services to pepsi

What's the best car ad of all time? - YouTube
boys hello
welcome to the world's first
and greatest marketing tuesday
look i made a little logo for it today's
marketing monday topic marketing tuesday
i'm sorry
what is the greatest car commercial
of all time
[Music]
we are going to look at different
auto manufacturers and how they've
approached marketing
and we're going to find out who is
crushing
who is being crushed
and what that means to my audience boom
before you guys judge some of these ads
here's the deal
the average age of car buyers by
brand this is one thing you need to know
going in dude 36 years old is the
youngest
i am seven years away or if you want to
make a chat joke
i am 50 years older than the oldest one
here okay
um in general car buyers are in their
late 30s
to late 40s it's that 10-year gap okay
so most car commercials are not designed
to appeal
to a cracked out zoomer fortnite
audience
put on your boomer hats today the
average tv user
is 55 plus
buy a lot okay
for every person you your age that
watches tv
a [ __ ] 80 to 90 year old has to watch
it
to even it out literally that's not a
joke for every
18 to 23 year old that watches an 80 to
90 year old watch is in return
okay the average age is old as
[ __ ] so i am opening now i have some i
have some ads already picked out
but i'm opening the ad review okay
it's the uh it's the actual ad dash
review in my discord
and if you have a car commercial please
drop it in i'll be watching a bunch of
car commercials in a row okay
and we're gonna review them and rate
them and talk about them
okay first one first one and then we're
gonna review it
so this is a hyundai ad okay
[Music]
hyundai genesis knows america cops are
here
win one little award and suddenly
everyone gets your name right
it's hyundai like sunday
okay 250. okay
four four is exactly oh you guys aren't
even oh
i'm not even showing on screen how
[ __ ] dumb is that four you guys
landed on a four
plurality around three to five yeah this
is a good range i would have given it a
four as well
i like this ad a lot because it solves a
very simple problem
all you remember from this ad maybe is
hyundai like sunday
and that enough has got
hyundai in your mind first of all as one
of the brands you can choose from as a
car company
and two you know how to pronounce it
because people being afraid of
pronouncing something
is enough to deter them from even
bringing it up if you're at a car
dealership
and you don't know how to say hyundai
you won't even
you won't buy it you'll be so you'll be
so you'll avoid it so
being able to say that alone is already
a win that's probably something i
discovered in market research and knew
they had to answer
secondly it has one simple
thing they won car of the year everyone
else is mad
so the quality's kind of [ __ ] which
sucks because
i think i released i remember this ad
and i remember seeing it and thinking
it was very obvious this is a bmw guy
uh this is a toyota guy like like the
logos were more
pronounced okay so
every other car company's mad they got
car of the year hyundai likes sunday
i i find this to be quite simple and
quite elegant and i think it did a good
job
dodge family motto
[Music]
cow
[Music]
[Music]
ricky okay our lawyers just want you to
know that this isn't real
my stunt driver is a 45 year old man
that's my boy forget what your smoking
hot mom
teachers say just remember my motto wake
up in the morning and piss excellence
don't always get a dna test now the
other one
if you ain't first
[Applause]
uh okay let me give you a
chance to rate
okay we got about enough i want to move
in so so you guys put it around a three
a three i think that's a little generous
i would put this at a one or a two
couple things i noticed right off the
rip it's a very creative idea
to uh leverage the popularity of
talladega nights with
only using the cheapest actor from it
so they were able to get the dad in
their budget
obviously they could not get uh
will ferrell so they got this guy
and then they used kids of it's a
creative idea
it's a creative idea um
uh i like gary cole he's very funny but
he's also the cheapest of the
of that cast and it makes perfect sense
they would hire him and save money
uh they do say piss excellence at a
commercial
which is crazy um
usually uh if you're using kids in an ad
you're trying to attract parents you're
trying to get
families so it's a little interesting
but uh you know i i can see that
uh the worst part about this ad i'm
gonna hide the poll now
uh for me is that you do not remember
the
which brand it is this is a trap that a
lot of marketers fall into when they
when they um glom onto something that's
already popular
to make their own uh ad more exciting
they they threw in this at the end but
like no one's
taking this away dude so that's why i
think this adds overall pretty weak and
it's actually a pretty
standard kind of lowish example of
trying to do this cross promotion kind
of thing
after this next one i'll have an idea i
want to talk about um
that's also pretty important here's a
g-pad
you bought a jeep yeah for the cheap
we're going to need a bigger boat
can i watch it again i might not have
gotten it
i'm gonna watch it again
you bought a jeep yeah for the cheap
we're going to need a bigger boat
you bought a jeep yeah i bought a cheap
we're going to need a bigger boat
yes yes
greatest dad of all time no i don't get
it i i know that it's i know it's from
jaws
i don't get why it has to do with
the jeep there's so many questions i
have
so i can pull more than the boat so the
kids saying hey
dad the jeep you bought can pull a
bigger boat than we currently have
so we're gonna need a bigger one is that
that's something huh okay
i get that i'm on board my second
question follow-up then is
why did they hire the devil to play the
child
that was an interesting choice why get
damien from the omen
to play this child that was an
interesting
what was that trying to say like their
competitors are the devil or what
they might have green screened it
uh okay i'm sorry i should not roast
four-year-old childs but
i i just this this ad we're going to
need a bigger boat
he just stares
he just stares at him he just looks at
him
he has no response no smile like oh you
precocious kid
he just there's a they just they let
that in
uncut three seconds he just stares back
i'm going to give this a
six the first six it's the greatest i've
ever seen check my mentions on twitter
okay why you guys want to see this i'm
happy to share it with you
it's rock for resident and it's
yeah man
that is something that is something
this is my reaction to stanza's tweet
dude this
this guy's face this is my reaction
100 to stanza's tweet uh
toyota 2012 tv commercial the cat and
the vet
[Music]
what the [ __ ] is this intro superstar
ads
funny scary well finally 720p
oh my god i give it a point for just
being 720p
animals always a good way to get some uh
to farm some feel strong men's
white people happy in chat boomers love
animals
budweiser's made a career off making
cute dogs and horses
uh do acts of heroism

brand story into it too let's find out
if they do in toyota's commercial
[Music]

damn this is a tight race 250's where i
stop it it's a one
but it's betw it's a lot of fives a lot
of ones
i assume some of the fives are memes
it's not an all-time great
stellar ad um
yeah listen you generally don't want to
do commercials about dying
pets you also don't generally don't want
to do commercials about
suicide you also generally don't want
the commercials about
pet necromancy cats getting mauled by
dogs having to drive to the vet over and
over
and really it takes a special chef
to cook all those ingredients into one
[ __ ]
minute long ad
they fit so much bad into this [ __ ]
sandwich
why the [ __ ] is the piezner resistance
pet suicide

get exactly what it's about
it sounds like you just saw an ad on the
internet and said oh
marketing monday hey truck do you invest
in spax
spax are having a moment right now but
no i don't
uh it's like a special purpose
acquisition company is what it means
companies going public
is a very long and arduous process let's
say you're a startup that's just [ __ ]
rocket fuel
your startup's doing amazing and you
want to go public it's called an ipo you
go public and that means your stock
is publicly available and anyone can buy
in and you can sell and
and the founders and the employees make
some money because they can sell their
stock now on the public markets
that's what's going public is you're on
you're on the exchange anyone can buy
you
a [ __ ] idiot on robin who can buy all
right
there's private companies that are
startups you can't go buy a startup
share
on on robinhood okay it's not public
okay
so what a spec does is it's like a
company that has already
filled out all the paperwork to go
public
it has done all the due diligence it's
done all the legal [ __ ]
everything because right now if you're a
company that's hot as [ __ ] and wants to
go public
the day you decide to do it it'll still
take minimum
eight to 12 months a spec has done all
that ahead of time
and what the spat does is essentially
acquire the startup so they can go
instantly public what i think is
happening
is all the money is being made in that
valuation increase while they're private
and then they're going public
essentially so everyone can cash out on
idiots
on robin hood for example
there's a company about to go public uh
called palantir i don't know if you guys
have heard of palantir
not paladin's the video game no not
people g pal it's the video game
they create software for like ice
and for like the military and like their
biggest client is the us government
and they have existed for i believe
let me get this right 17 years
and they are going public at a
valuation of like 15 billion or
something 20 billion
guess how many years of those 17 years
they made money
[Music]
somebody gets 20.
zero none of them this company has lost
money
for 17 years and is trying to go public
at a 20 billion dollar valuation it's
insane it's
crooked working at a startup i can talk
about this right now and this is
actually a pretty good topic for
for uh marketing monday because i've
worked at a startup twitch i worked at
twitch
okay number one you usually get paid
less
but you get a bigger title quickly
so you get more responsibility second
thing
you got to remember is that you should
get some form of stock
if you're working in a startup for no
stock
you are generally stupid quack
says hr would you could have a startup i
you know you're not going to get stuck
for being my editor
i'm not giving you stock in hrock for
being my editor quack i want you to know
do not ask for things in a job
negotiation
until they are ready to hire you until
they're making you an offer
okay don't show up the interview and say
hey what's your vacation policy
always get to the phase where they're
like right there where they they see you
in the job
or you can do what i did and scream yes
the second twitch offers you
any amount of money including 45k in san
francisco which is way below market
and you have to [ __ ] scrape for food
for a year
how do i go about asking your boss for a
raise asking your boss for a raise
is interesting because it
usually means that you are not happy
with the company
the second an employee comes into his
office and asks for a raise
the first thing he's thinking is oh [ __ ]
i gotta find someone new
i got i gotta replace this guy not
because they're gonna fire him
because this guy's probably gonna end up
leaving in general a raise is a sign of
deeper
problems i mean it's all about leverage
really so you should say like hey i'm
one of your best employees
i work hard as hell i need a raise to
continue being happy here
i love this place always this is the
thing i do all the time i'm not sure if
it's the perfect answer but in general
my advice is
always include hey i'm happy here i love
this place this place is great
there's just a few things that would
help make it perfect okay let me tell
you something else
the three things that are correlated
with having a happy job with being happy
with your job
number one you feel like your work
helps or impacts others now hear me out
this does not mean that you are making a
positive difference in the world
that's not required you don't need to be
a [ __ ] doctor curing cancer
what it means is that some other human
being
sees your work as valuable and that
you're helping them
so for example quack my editor if he
made a good video
i am very happy i think i thank him
thank you quack your personal
contribution
helped that is a that's good that's good
okay if you feel like nobody notices
when you do your work when you do a good
job or a bad job
that generally leads to you feeling like
miserable in a job okay that's
what's one sign of a job that will
become miserable if there's a number you
can go to your boss and say hey i did
this
and i did it better than x or i did it
worse than x or it's getting better
you feel better about your job but if
your job yeah quantifiable
your job needs to be quantifiable in
some way if you can't quantify it
then what happens is you are at the
mercy of
your boss's whims it comes down to
whether your boss likes you on that day
doesn't like you on that day
um is it a bad mood what if i'm a
prostitute and my pimp never tells me
good job
only fans dude pimps are outdated
sims over pimps holy [ __ ]
we just defeated pimps with marketing
sips over pimps
we're stopping sex trafficking only fans
is one of the greatest successes for
like
workers owning the product ever
now only fans still big corporation
takes a cut so it's not perfect but
so at this point he owned the free sites
and he owned the paid sites
in other words he had a monopoly
monopoly we hate with our police money
hungry family game
it's 600 a scene don't say ah a true
classic like it's [ __ ]
citizen kane okay chad it's an old
[ __ ] porno
don't put on your [ __ ] monocle and be
like oh yes
back when cinema was good
[ __ ] it it's an old porno he creeps
then they tell people to subscribe to
their premium snapchat
we talked about our private snapchat
i'll leave the link
for our private snapchat in the
description and watch us view [ __ ]
i thought that this model was something
that snapchat officially offered
that's good marketing direct good
direct marketing the customer wants to
know what they're paying for
in one that's better tagline that's a
better tagline
than i've heard from a lot of fortune
500 companies
actually just they act like they don't
make any money because like piracy like
now that i make my own [ __ ] like they're
[ __ ] making money and they're lying
saying that they can only afford to pay
you a thousand dollars a month that's
not true
tell them for real though for real
though
that is the truth for every business i'm
trying to expand this a little bit
so you guys can see it's more than just
porn porn is one of the industries
that's like
we have a success story here in almost
every industry
they will tell you they can't afford to
pay you more they almost
always can they almost always can
they just don't want to they want the
mclaren
jeff bezos has a monopoly on being a hot
ass bald man catch me sipping
well speaking of that that actually
segues
right in to today's marketing monday
topic now i've talked about a lot of
things today
we're gonna try to pack it all into a
video
but i'm gonna talk about uh i'm talking
about amazon marketing mondays
more specifically amazon luna let me
[ __ ] pull up their trailer
other streamers are probably getting
bounties to play this trailer
and here i am playing it for free
i guess i'm [ __ ] on it though it's a
little bit different that's why the
bounty wouldn't be helpful
[Music]
wow wait don't gloss it over amazon
don't
you gloss so quickly i wanted to see
your amazing lineup of games i'm sure
it's very deep
oh look at all these games control
that's the aaa title
you showed that one i'm sure there's a
lot more aaa games right
just like tacoma
[Music]
mummy
i love playing
uh all right so first thing i'll say is
this ad sucks
it's only slightly better than stadia's
ad
can i show you stadius that cause i i
want stadius ad
really pissed me off the amount of money
they spent holy mackerel
stadia is only the newest most blocked
chad i'm sorry i have to warn you
warning warning warning warning warning
put up your cringe shields
please everyone in chat this is an
actual cringe alert
it's the only way to get through this
whole ad
otherwise you might die you may cringe
right out of your chair into cringiac
arrest
free-range humans stadia travels across
screens
free your mind at the one place for all
the ways
we play stadium wow
you guys maybe have stadia
that ad is holds up spork random
i hated it that is the worst way to
position your new service
only fans watch out for it
stadia by the way stadia spent an
absolutely absurd amount of money on
marketing that
out of the gate to get almost no
subscribers
i mean really bad
amazon luna
i think is here we're talking about
what's good good about all of them
what's good and bad
who's gonna win the streaming war
one payment yeah yeah yeah
okay let me explain why that's important
because
[ __ ] stadia is so stupid
that they made a service where you
you pay monthly for stadia you pay a fee
for the controller and then you still
have to buy the games
you have to buy this service and like
it's like buy netflix and you have to
buy all the movies on it
that's crazy what year do they think
they're in
no one will do that geforce now i'd put
maybe a little bit higher than luna
because it has the best tech
the reason xcloud's so godlike is
they're going to tie the payment in
one monthly payment with
xbox game pass they're gonna tie the two
together
then they also have by far
the most games uh-oh
turns out that's the most important
thing of all that
this is why this circle here
is why this console war is so important
because the winner of this console war
is likely gonna win this cloud war
okay and the winner of the cloud war is
the winner for life
now i haven't seen a nintendo cloud
service talked about
but i am quite certain knowing nintendo
they will do absolutely everything wrong
but one more person to talk about and
then i'm done i filled this chart i
think i've explained a lot i'm gonna
talk about one more person
the elephant in the room that no one's
talking about
bum bum
you already have all of your games
on steam a massive library
if they could just find an easy way for
you to stream those onto any
computer or monitor or phone
you'd already be locked in you don't
want to leave your library behind
valve is just slow the real problem with
valve
and steam is not they don't make great
[ __ ]
it's that they are excruciatingly small
and slow
they keep a small number of employees
who are all filthy rich
and they work slowly i think steam could
win this
or what could be really interesting
is steam partnering with one of these
guys
i mean this would be crazy but what if
microsoft microsoft doesn't care about
games for windows i mean
they care about them they don't think of
it as a competitor
you know what if it's a steam x xbox
thing
steam x luna steam you know steam x
nintendo
oh my god it fits
my aunt has like a seven-year-old son
and she doesn't know anything about
gaming or streaming or anything but she
knows i worked at twitch
she's like you know all about youtube
and twitch and stuff do you know this
guy
and i was like let me check i don't
think i know him
so i googled him he's a roblox youtuber
who uploads twice a day every video gets
like four million views
all he does is just [ __ ] scream and
play roblox
look at me oh my god
look behind you like look at your back
[Laughter]
oh my god can i shoot you oh god
you bank get out go away dude i will
never leave
oh my god
who said finally good content who the
[ __ ] said
finally good control on a truck stream
[ __ ] you
dude no no no no no no no
no dude you can't sense i'm pouring my
soul out
on marketing monday and i play a [ __ ]
10 second clip
of this idiot screaming over roblox and
you go
finally finally oh finally some good
content
i've been waiting for some good content
on this [ __ ] stream [ __ ] you dude
and uh it gets huge so don't never up
underestimate roblox in minecraft that's
all i'm saying
people don't have the right sense of
scale in this in the gaming world
flamingo no no flamenco no
no i'm sorry what i said
hi guys i just want to say that um
i may have i was joking earlier all that
stuff i said about
amazon luna and flamingo
they are really really funny and
entertaining and wholesome can't do that
anyway boys i think that covers it for
marketing monday i'm i'm not
done obviously i'm i'm open for
questions
a little bit to talk more i was gonna
play some hades runs probably
haiti's my current game of the year and
i'm getting farther in the story
The Return of the Xbox. - YouTube
oh xbox has your attention now ah
thinking of copping the new amd gpu from
strawberry
that's funny that is a hoot that's funny
thinking a cop for the new amd gpu
where was that particular little message
who the [ __ ] said it huh there it is
straw hat lad
oh boy i'll see you in an hour where
your ass was at last marketing monday
when we talked about sony and they're
actually that was probably marketing
wednesday because they revealed it
sony's big [ __ ] reveals of their
games and their price
and we said damn this war's heating up
but i'd give the edge to sony
and microsoft watched dude bill gates
himself watched my last marketing monday
and he said
[ __ ] hdrx still give sony the edge we
got to do something
and they brought a [ __ ] nuke dude
they brought their kill streak
they pulled it out so we're going to
talk about that today we're going to
talk about that
xbox mall they didn't get tick tock so
they took bethesda
that's one theory oh
but first it's pasta time delicious
pasta
straight from chef ari
here's a good website for you guys it's
a fun little website
it's called assetdash.com it shows you
the
most valuable companies in the world in
a current ranking
apple currently the most valuable in the
world microsoft's second most valuable
1.5 trillion
true you guys are right there they are
worth quite a bit
but nvidia's not that far behind you
we're top
20 and video right here
well that was a good intro those were
all related to today's topic
marketing monday xbox just struck
back the revenge
bill gates from beyond the grave when
he's not busy
putting microchips in our vaccines
as my aunt told me about on facebook is
actually
telling the microsoft board to acquire
bethesda for 7.5
billion dollars one of the largest
acquisitions in the gaming space ever
for reference let me try to draw you up
something here this is marketing monday
after all
let me try to give you guys a sense of
scale i feel like you guys never get aacqu
sense of scale
oh well speaking of that i did not scale
this [ __ ]
scene correctly there's two
why do i have one large one in front of
one small one
this is how i present nvidia dude i
always have one powerpoint that's
zoomed in in front of another one so
twitch was a pretty big acquisition
that was acquired by amazon for
one billion dollars a little under
actually
one billion dollars
mojang was acquired this is
minecraft which was the biggest game in
the world at the time
it was acquired
and also and also attracts an audience
that's hard to get which is kids
who tend to stick to a few number of
games
this one oh just a different one was
acquired let's say like this
2.5 billion dollars
wow 2.5 billion
that is a [ __ ] a lot of money i
personally bought it for [ __ ]
15 on java and today
dwarfing all of this by a
massive factor was bethesda
and all of its games in perpetuity
bethesda and zenimax
for seven and a half billion
dollars let's get a bit of a comparison
going on here
to some even larger numbers that i was
put this into context
this is how much
this is how much sony made
all year this is a flex
this is a flex this is
microsoft having a beef with someone and
going and buying a car
that's about as much the other person
makes in a year yeah they make about 8.3
billion
a year in net income
this is not like people i think that
don't know the console wars
think that microsoft and sony are
similar sized companies
and they are not it is not close
microsoft's yearly income would not fit
on this chart
it's near like 48 billion and
uh all of sony's other businesses are
not doing that well
sony owns a movie studio i don't know if
you guys know that the the spider-man
pictures come out through sony
spider-man owns the rights to uh sony's
right spider-man
um
they also they mean they make tvs
consumer products
people aren't buying walkmans though let
me tell you
sony's worth 100 billion but that's
still 1 15th of microsoft
okay and their income is about one
between the microsoft two so there you
go
sony could not afford the exposition
this exogen is a flex in the console war
this is microsoft continuing to say we
will not
lose this microsoft has set it as
clearly made it
a strategic priority an important
[ __ ] part of their future of their
business in gaming
to win this console war and use that to
win the cloud gaming more they have to
do that they want to be netflix at
gaming
now how does netflix win versus its
competitors
by having more exclusive content how do
you get more exclusive content
you buy it okay netflix does this by
buying
um exclusive production deals with
people like adam sandler or production
companies or
things like that that's where netflix
originals come from what microsoft is
going to do is not make their own
they're going to buy
studios and then and then essentially
make their own okay and
sony knows this okay and it's gonna be
hard for them to counter that
one of their biggest advantages sony had
was better games
they have more consistent lineup of
better games microsoft is willing to
spend their way out of that hole and
this is sort of proving it now let's
talk about some of the main things
people are saying
number one is they're saying oh well i
heard that the games won't be exclusive
let me be very clear
bethesda games aaa games going forward
are very very likely to not come out on
playstation
almost certainly and for sure will not
come out on any other pass service
okay it'll be either timed exclusive
with some kind of way to make money in
the in the back end or they'll be pure
exclusives
you do not spend 7.5 billion dollars on
a company
that will help your competitor okay
that's not why you do it don't say 7.5
ninjas
someone in chat saying they don't want
their expensive game company to not keep
printing dollar bills
let me tell you something you don't buy
bethesda because it prints dollar bills
okay you buy bethesda because owning the
netflix of gaming
prints dollar bills and you need games
to do that
you are willing to take a loss bethesda
is going to take a loss
they're not worried about making extra
money by selling a few more copies of
elder scrolls on [ __ ]
uh playstation they don't care if
bethesda as a unit makes money anymore
it's like twitch with amazon prime it's
it's like or twitch prime i'm sorry
twitch does not make money twitch
currently loses money now there is goals
that's why you hear about the new forced
mid-rolls and everything
all the ad stuff amazon is trying to
make twitch more profitable
but at the end of the day twitch and
amazon prime video and all that [ __ ]
is a service to sell toilet paper it's a
service
to make you hooked into amazon prime so
you buy all that [ __ ] on amazon
okay all this [ __ ] is part of our larger
egos it are lost leaders
owning bethesda is part of that
their goal is to dominate the cloud and
they will stop at nothing okay
and clearly they think it's [ __ ]
important
because these are expensive acquisitions
7.5 billion
is a lot of money to throw at this and
7.5 billion dollars plus they're making
the consoles so [ __ ] cheap they're
losing money on it
so between those two things microsoft is
going to be bleeding money for the
launch this xbox
and they have to get market share they
have to they have to publish this game
for ps5 exclusively
that's so this game is gonna be so dog
[ __ ] supported
i can't imagine a game with fewer
upcoming patches
this game's gonna be buggy as [ __ ]
you think bethesda is gonna spend time
supporting death loop after they're
literally
owned by microsoft
that is so funny it's a time exclusive
yeah all right we'll wait for the time
to run out before you see any updates
i'll tell you that
now uh that's not again this is not the
end of anything
but it is another [ __ ] notch in in
microsoft's cap
what we're finding out the real [ __ ]
weapon they have
is game pass sony's trying to make
something and with all the ps4 games
they're getting somewhere close it's
good but game pass is just a lot of
value
dick now i think the real winner on both
these [ __ ] consoles is
is pc because everything is no longer
exclusive to consoles dude
even when microsoft buys bethesda
they're happy with uh
everything come out on pc so it's
awesome for pc dude
it really is a good [ __ ] all this
news has been only good for pc
because to make up the cost of getting
everything exclusive
both sides are releasing everything on
pc for extra cash they don't see pc as a
threat
which means the pc value proposition to
a consumer is actually [ __ ] huge
right as some of the greatest gpus in
history are hitting
i'll pog you xbox one well xbox one
lost the war hard as i mentioned in my
first marketing monday
xbox one was a total disaster ps4 won
handily and uh
this is gonna be the close one nobody's
nobody's just flopping out of the gate
ps3 was kind of a flop out of the gate
and so xbox won that one
and in the next one xbox one was a flop
out of the gate and so sony won that one
now neither side are flopping out of the
gate both sides realize that it sucks
when they lose
and listen here's the most important
thing
if there's one thing you take away from
all this it's this
okay let me go full screen tell you
whoever wins the next generation could
win
forever it probably it's either the next
generation the one right after that
whoever wins the generation where we go
to the cloud
is the permanent winner okay because
once you get locked into a subscription
service
you don't want to leave it once
once you're on netflix for example
you're hooked for life people are
netflix forever they don't they don't
leave
once you're once you have your cloud
gaming service that has all of your
games forever
you don't want to leave it it's like
steam dude nobody wants to leave steam
it could be multiple shirts yeah you
could buy both yes they could be
they're not going to die but i'm saying
once one gets the lead it's very hard to
ever lose it
nobody's taking over netflix's spot dude
disney plus
came out of the gate with a huge [ __ ]
marketing blitz they have great titles
disney plus is doing well it has not
hurt netflix at all
netflix is the clear number one locked
in okay
so i would say this is a very important
generation
this is like the most important and
i think microsoft clearly realizes it
and sony's starting to realize i think
sony just like
does their thing and they're good at it
and ps5 is going to be great but i think
xbox knows this is like their do or die
moment
and they're spending dummy money
someone asked the all-important question
will this stunning
picture of a mountain
be xbox exclusive elder scrolls six
will this mountain be only on xbox
you know what i think yes
i do i mean on pc it'll be on pc and
xbox
here's what i don't think uh here
there's two options
no yeah i mean there's actually three
options the third is that it never gets
released
and that one might be the most likely
they don't have to work anymore
everyone in bethesda is doing bong hits
and go and buying ferraris
they all just made a boatload they're
not going to work hard on this
but assuming it comes out here's the
deal
they're the options are time dicks
they're they're they they haven't
decided yet here's the actual answer is
i can't predict it because they haven't
decided they're thinking about it i'm
certain i'm sure having meetings right
now
the first wave of bethesda games will
probably have
timed exclusive some multi-platform
to keep up appearances and to get
through the churn of things that are
already being worked on
that's probably what happened long term
this shit's all going exclusive to
microsoft
they own it 7.5 billion you buy
something you want it to be exclusive
now will elder scrolls six ever show up
in a
sony game pass or a bundle or
a uh or their cloud service no never
ever ever
guaranteed will you be able to buy a
disk copy
of this game on ps5 maybe i can't say no
on that
because the compute the the community
outrage would be high
that being said it's still very likely
this game is a killer app
killer apps are you able to buy your
consoles if they make this exclusive
people will buy xbox for it and so why
wouldn't they
yeah now if todd howard has anything to
say about it this game's gonna be out on
your refrigerator before it hits ps5
this game will be out on your [ __ ]
calculator
on your watch on your uh
on your [ __ ] roomba before it comes
out on ps5
todd howard will put this game out on
every [ __ ] possible screen
but i don't think it's gonna make it to
your ps5 but we'll see
when netflix first started okay netflix
was dvd
by mail delivery service and when they
started streaming
it was all other people's content okay
they had friends they had the office
they had
other people's content and those studios
didn't know the value of their content
on streaming so they did great deals for
netflix
they said yeah just give us a little bit
of a cut you can put it online the real
monies and dvds and tv
okay so netflix got a huge advantage
head start but they realized after
everyone started pulling their content
back
off that oh [ __ ] we need our own content
to fill the gaps
if we rely on other people we're going
to be out we're going to be [ __ ]
so they started paying billions of
dollars netflix is spending more than
anyone else other than maybe disney
on making their own content their own
movies their own shows etc
okay the first year they did this they
spent like two billion dollars and all
the investors were like whoa
you're spending two billion dollars on
[ __ ] content
this is crazy and they said next year
we're gonna spend more and they did and
they kept spending more
what i'm trying to say to you is if
microsoft believes in this strategy
7.5 billion in bethesda is not the
beginning
i mean it's not the end it is the
beginning
microsoft is very likely going to spend
more money
to acquire more studios and more
exclusives
and try to get a completely unbeatable
cloud gaming service
the only thing that [ __ ] up for them
was mixer flopping they really planned
on mixer doing better
so they could have they could own the
streaming they could have you end to end
you'd log on you'd watch your favorite
streamer on mixer
you could click in right into the cloud
and play the game
on xbox game pass you'd have the xbox
machine in your living room
it would be a whole ecosystem because
that's how gamers
that is the most important thing for
gamers today is like most gamers
watch [ __ ] on on twitch and youtube and
they
um they play games on their console and
then
if they get a they get a subscription
service they'll use that for the cloud
microsoft wanted to own all three and
they flopped on mixer
they flopped hard so that that was a
weakness in their armor
because the most popular games of
tomorrow are still going to be
determined
by influencers on twitch and youtube
that's gotten more and more important
and microsoft doesn't own them and can
never own them
because amazon and and uh and google
owned them and they're just as big
so we'll see how that plays out but um
because okay so now let me explain a
little bit more
every game company now has to include in
their budget
if they're smart money for twitch and
youtube influencers
they have to they have to spend money on
on
these things if you're going to make
your game big
you got to spend money on twitching
youtube influencers okay
it's hard not to so
microsoft doesn't want to be in a world
where they are releasing games on their
own studios
they have to constantly spend money to
amazon and google
but they have to that's the world they
live in
mixer mixer flopped extract do you think
there's a conflict in competition in
monopolistic practices if they start
acquiring more studios yes
do i think anyone at all in any country
will enforce anti-monopoly
procedures no
no i don't monopolies no longer get
punished
okay say with me we love
monopolies what if microsoft bought
discord
that's not crazy it's actually one of
the smartest things i heard in chat dude
so nobody's acquired discord yet discord
is the hottest acquisition i would think
among anyone trying to build a whole
ecosystem in the gaming space
discord is like where twitch was if you
think about where twitch was when it got
acquired
that's where discord is right now i bet
you get discord for about one to two
billion dollars
and it's worth it discord is actually a
very smart suggestion i wasn't even
thinking about that
but they are actually at the perfect
stage of their life to get acquired
what's your favorite xbox game franchise
let me list all the great ones
well there's halo
elder scrolls elder scrolls
fallout
those that's a big three that's a killer

I know who will win the Console Wars. - YouTube
today is marketing monday if you guys
don't know
my full-time job for the past four years
now for three years has been global
marketing manager at nvidia
and before that i did content marketing
management for
twitch i was a marketer twitch and i'm a
marketer nvidia okay
so in the gaming industry for seven
years now
doing marketing okay so
i think about marketing a lot i got some
opinions on it
and i have some pretty strong opinions
about what's about to happen
with sony versus microsoft ps5 versus
xbox series x so i want to talk about
the history first okay
i want you guys to know where we're
coming from xbox 360 versus ps3 is the
first one
now going into this generation
the ps2 was the best-selling console and
still is i believe
in history the ps2
dominated the world if you are old
enough to remember the ps2
you probably had one the ps2 i'm gonna
make it fat it was a big
chungus okay are you following so far
i'm trying to give you a visual
the ps2 was a dominant
console it beat the [ __ ] out of all
competition
its competition was xbox and gamecube
gamecube did terribly
rest in peace it had melee so it's still
great and xbox did all right
ps2 wins but xbox comes to play with the
360.
and they actually [ __ ] dominate
america so what um
microsoft did was they came out with a
very attractive
price point for the 360. they were
losing about
twenty-five dollars per console
every time you bought a console they
lost money
that is how attractive the pricing was
okay
but they managed to gain market share
and some more games
so they were happy it all worked out
xbox 360
outsold ps3 about two to one in america
europe was basically sony
oybrov love me a ps3 that was a direct
quote from the prime minister of great
britain
but it was pretty close europe was
pretty close
and japan was a thousand percent
sony that's the only reason that ps3
ended up barely outselling xbox at the
end of the console generation
but overall it was a tie then
came the reckoning
and that is the generation where
the ps4 shows up
and that's when xbox
the xbox one starts [ __ ] its pants
ps4 outsells xbox one
worldwide over two to one
microsoft got their ass
kicked i don't know how else to tell you
this they lost everywhere
everywhere bought more ps4s than
uh xbox ones microsoft is
nervous going into this next generation
they gotta get a hit
they had a big idea with mixer let's
just put a picture of ninja in here
this will help you guys understand
what's going on they paid a lot of money
to buy
mixer and they paid even more money to
get ninja
and before the next console's even out
this is already flopped
this is over so this plan has failed
i should have a sidebar here where i say
that this is the worst [ __ ] marketing
naming scheme that i've ever [ __ ]
heard dude
the xbox series s and the xbox series
x is so [ __ ]
confusing and stupid
especially i mean look it goes from xbox
to xbox 360
to xbox one i believe there was one in
the middle too right
what was xbox one xbox one s
the xbox xbox one s
into the xbox series s who the [ __ ]
knows the difference okay so
early on xbox realized
after the first xbox that if they called
the second one
xbox two it would look bad compared to
the ps3
and they didn't want that and so they
[ __ ] themselves
for all eternity microsoft
is worth 1.5 trillion
smackeroonies sony's worth
generously i believe about this much as
a company
let me let me let me explain why i'm
talking about this okay
microsoft as a 1.5 trillion dollar
company
has a responsibility to all its
shareholders to tell them
how it's going to grow to a two trillion
dollar company
how's it going to get bigger even if
microsoft
were to [ __ ] gain the value of sony
all
they could just own like if sony just
came and said hey you have us now
they would still only go to 1.6 trillion
that's not enough they have to grow at
least 10 percent they got to be
promising growth
they need to grow 150 billion dollars
okay minimum to get a 10 growth
what is worth a hundred and fifty
billion dollars
mcdonald's is worth 150 billion dollars
so they could add
they come with an idea that's as good as
mcdonald's
then they can grow ten percent that's
how big microsoft is
exxon mobil
that's right they could also come up
with an idea as good as
owning the biggest oil company it's
[ __ ]
crazy how big microsoft is dude
or and what they're actually thinking of
netflix they want to invent
the netflix for gaming that's an idea
big enough to be worth microsoft's time
sony's not worth microsoft's time
is what i'm trying to say to you guys
winning the console war
is not even worth microsoft's time
they're thinking bigger so they realized
holy [ __ ] mixer didn't work none of our
other shit's working
if we lose this console war we've got no
way to get into gamers homes
and start this [ __ ] process on
getting them signed up for project
xcloud
and so they made a judgment call they
said
[ __ ] it we're gonna lose money on these
shits
series x 499
series s 299
this is [ __ ] crazy cheap for the
hardware they're putting in there
it's a price so low that consumers stop
doing comparisons they stop thinking
about well this one has this benefit or
this benefit
it's like a pressure price it's like a
price that just makes you
want to jump on it now what does sony
have on their side
they have the flex factor
better games higher install base
currently problem here is that microsoft
has so much [ __ ] money
they can afford to lose
everything on this console to make it
back
by becoming the netflix of gaming sony
can't do that dude
so if you guys don't know on wednesday
and i'm going to be watching it live on
streams you want to watch with live
reacts
on wednesday sony's going to be doing a
conference
and i think they're going to be talking
majority about
this i'm going to make it bigger for you
they want to remind people
hey [ __ ] all this future [ __ ]
yes maybe one day in the future google
stadia and streaming games on xbox
[ __ ] live
will be good but right now they're not
and so what we have now
is better games if
rachel buys and a playstation
okay and joins the blue man group ross
and chandler are gonna buy it too
so they can game with her okay and
eventually they're all gonna buy it
whoever gets out to an early lead
snowballs this has been proven for every
console generation
i was gung-ho completely on sony i think
it depends very much on sony's price if
they can price
close to xbox doesn't have to be the
same in fact being slightly more pricier
usually gives you a prestige factor
there's a marketing aspect to that
there's a bit of a flex factor look
iphones are more expensive than androids
iphone's doing great
apple's the most valuable company on
earth how is owning a ps5 a flex factor
so this let's go into this on the
marketing side this is the flex factor
case study okay
year over year over year iphone sales
were doing great
they were crushing iphone was the
[ __ ]
it has amazing margins it makes a ton of
[ __ ] money they were selling them
like hot cakes
five six seven eight nine they're all
selling great and then it got to either
the nine
or the ten or the x or i forget which
one it was
but they made it cost a thousand dollars
and they didn't change how it looked it
was just better on the inside it was you
couldn't tell the difference between
that one and the previous one
that iphone flopped okay
it did extremely poorly based on project
it didn't do
it didn't do terribly like it's still
apple but it did very
poorly based on projections and
everyone was asking why and all the
analysts were saying like oh it's
because china
is losing uh interest in apple's luxury
brand
oh consumers don't want to pay a
thousand dollars for an iphone blah blah
blah they were saying a lot of things
and my theory which i think has been
proven true
was that no one wants to spend a
thousand dollars on a phone
unless their friends know they spent a
thousand dollars in the phone
but the problem was you were spending
less money on the phone
and from the back no one could tell it
was the new one
you couldn't flex okay and so
apple solved this problem with this
their next iphone had a very gaudy
noticeable camera change in the back and
this let everyone know
that you had the new file they didn't
lower the price in fact i think they i
think they raised the price still
and it did [ __ ] amazing this
phone sold like bananas
this phone did [ __ ] awesome
and so all those previous theories were
like totally wrong
and it turns out everyone's fine paying
absurd amounts of money for the phone
as long as they can flex on their
friends as long as their friends know
they did it
and that's why i promise you i promise
you
whatever apple's next phone is we'll
have something about the camera
that is different that you can tell even
though this camera design looks fine and
they can just upgrade the front and the
insides which is what you're actually
upgrading
they're gonna they're just gonna
superficially change something about
this camera so you know it's the new one
why does this have to do anything with
sony and microsoft so
i think i talked about this when sony
revealed their design
the ps5 is the ultimate
flex factor design and it allows them i
think
to charge more uh whether you think
it's ugly or not or looks like a router
or not or whatever
doesn't really matter the cool thing
about flex factor in marketing
is that it doesn't matter if it's ugly
or beautiful as long as you can tell
that it's expensive
again i'm getting a very strong iphone
versus android vibe here
where android is cheaper and has more
market share
but uh is almost entirely
among poorer people i think we're gonna
end up where
both of these consoles do well but
sony's gonna be more expensive
considered higher end
and bought by families with high
disposable income and xbox is gonna have
a larger market share i think possibly
55 to 60
among poorer people because right now
the big worry is that xbox doesn't have
outside of halo infinite which could be
bad we really don't know a lot about it
uh they don't have a lot coming for them
that's their big that's their big thing
so let's pull up the ps5 exclusives
they're gonna have god of war two okay
they they're they're
that whether or not it's ready at launch
because maybe they're [ __ ] scrambling
they're gonna announce something about
god of war
ii around or before the launch
okay it's just it's just too smart not
to the elder scrolls six announcement
was so [ __ ]
funny because they had nothing they
clearly had nothing
but they needed something for their show
because they had been [ __ ] burned on
fallout 4
and investors were nervous so they
showed a picture of a mountain and said
elder scrolls 6
coming eventually it was embarrassing
but they had to announce something to
get people excited again and the real
moral of this story chat
i think i've covered the main basics
here my my general takeaway is that
i was going to say ps5 will win this
generation and now i'm pretty confident
it's going to be a [ __ ]
bare knuckle brawl i think it's going to
be one of the greatest
console wars now the real winner of
course
chat is the nvidia rtx 3080
which sort of dominates all the
competition
in fact it dominates dare i
say the globe
and so the real takeaway chat if you've
learned anything from today's marketing
monday
it's that whether or not you care about
sony or microsoft
you probably want to just get a 30
series card and play games
the way they're meant to be played so
hopefully that helped you guys
cover some of the some of the
the [ __ ] going on behind the scenes okay
with these [ __ ] consoles and what
microsoft's really thinking about
and uh and who's gonna edge out on top
there's a lot to come
and i'm very excited to see what happens
on wednesday hopefully you'll watch it
with me i'm going to be watching live
Sell me this Ad. - YouTube
we're gonna do an ad review stream today
if you don't understand the concept of
ad review let me explain it to you I
work in marketing professionally I
studied marketing in school we
collectively will be sifting through a
treasure trove of hundreds of ads to
find the very best using a voting system
one through five after every ad chat
we'll vote we will talk about it then
we'll move on to the next ad it's a fun
quick light-hearted fun experience let
us jump in to the first ad and then I
will give you a rating get ready
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
what do you think rate this ad chad has
universally put this as a three what a
curve what a bell-curve average ad
forgettable commercial well here's what
I'll say this ad is in the final episode
of Mad Men it is the ending credits it
is an iconic ad of the time in modern
times it's a little bit we look coltie
actually be honest with you but at the
time the concept of people putting aside
their differences coming together really
associating your product with peace and
happiness in a way that it does not
deserve it's just sugar water I probably
give this a four for posterity this is
the 1971 you guys understand different
different era I think of four is
warranted but uh you guys have reviewed
it with your modern lens and given it a
three then it gets fun it's very it's
very average next add oh this is an
all-time classic
[Music]
[Music]
and you'll see why 1984 won't be like
1984 all right we got what do we got
right this ad where do you put apples
1984 out of other running in the
background with sound off so you guys
you just remember you guys put it as a
four it's fair but it's wrong this is a
five unfortunately boys and I even on
rewatch it's a little crunch but for the
time this has set apple's marketing
strategy for the next three decades
they're the outsider they're the
creative one this is a five when it came
out
it's very pretentious this is Apple
versus IBM this is one of the great
examples of positioning of all time they
positioned IBM their competitor with a
stigma that has painted them to this day
as boring zombies suits as the
establishment this is the early example
of the auto Mac on PC ad they
successfully positioned IBM as the
corporate zombie suits and Apple as the
hot ones Youth color attractive and he's
crazy and they chose the hooters outfit
I can't unsee the hooters outfit this ad
was very successful on my on my scale it
to five although I do see a lot of
things don't hold up about it and it is
it's an incredibly pretentious next Bud
Light NFL quinoa HDS is making fun of
teen white and liberals
why does she pack these things hate one
by accident last time baby boy what the
heck is that it's clean Oh
bud light for the fans who do whatever
it takes
ready you guys put this as a three this
is pretty forgettable right this is very
basic like hahaha vegetarians I mean
it's a safe target right because even
people who like eating meat alternatives
are probably not a big fan of cardboard
quinoa alternate patties the product is
so sparsely featured and the journey
like he never the main character in this
thing never takes a swig of Bud but it's
not involved in his journey at all what
I would really like if I had to change
one thing about this at what I think
it's pretty forgettable if it was
halftime and his team was down and he
thinks back to the last game where he
had to eat this quinoa burger and his
team came back and he thinks about it
and it looks gross and he looks at it
and his wife smiling at him and he looks
at it and his wife smiling at him and he
looked at the scoreboard and he takes a
swig of a swig of Bud
chomps it chomps it and all of a sudden
ending shot you hear about that they
hear they score they score the team
turns around and then he close there's
no stakes it's just him grilling he's
thinking in his head we don't really
care and also the beers like never
featured outside of these two people who
don't know what's going on in his head
they just look at him and smile
it's

inspired by a true story why I have
nothing problem with a man and woman
having a friendship and the woman
marrying someone else that's not a crazy
thing I don't need to be a strawberry
store but why twice set it up like this
I will never forget my smile when I
first laid eyes on you
I told myself she's the one and then why
I built this story like this you guys
voted this a 1 but a lot of you voted
this of 5 it is very weird even you know
as emotionally mature as I'm sure all
twitch chatters are who would never spam
cut cut cut cut this guy's a [ __ ] I'm
sure you guys are way too mature for
that I would just say even if we take
that word out of our cab you Larry and
we're not it's a weird person to have as
your mascot right he's clearly in love
with this girl he's reminiscing about
her no it's weird my marketing brains on
all right let me tell you something if
this guy doesn't get cut to the end of
this ad it is a boring long forgettable
ad the point of this adds the give
people talking enough I'm not a believer
of the school any publicity is good
publicity at least we're talking about
it it only really applies if your
complete unknown so I don't know about
this ad but it is more memorable than it
was before he got cut I'll say that
thirstiest time of the year sprite Shh
what do we got music bass commercial
must be sick to be LeBron dude for many
reasons but the fact that he had to go
to a vocal booth and say and he's done
for the day
probably netted five hundred G's for
this ad I gotta go I'm LeBron I gotta go
why is there so many fives it's a meme
but also very good well I mean yes right
sprite cranberries good we're not voting
on the product boys this is fine I would
have been happy with a three this is too
rapid they don't really pay off that
it's the thirstiest time of the year
with claymation celebrities and the
LeBron busting it says one uh spike
cranberry what I mean what are you
talking about actually in it
there's memes there's a bunch of memes
okay let's see sprite cranberry memes I
get it alright I'm coming around I'm
coming around these memes suck but I get
the idea that everyone would think the
way LeBron delivered this line is very
funny
creepy Japanese Kobe consume pan sheet
dog commercials get ready to write this
voice
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
read it read it read it write it damn
you guys like this one alright here's
what I'll say I'm finishing the poll is
not a five-star ad this is not long-long
man esque it ain't boring and what I
noticed that I thought was really cool
was this all the scenes they showed at
the beginning of the ad were real
problems that a kid a Mississippi their
target market his children would be
stressed about the kids worried about
school I don't want to get a zero on a
test I'm where my parents are gonna be
mad at me
this magical flying dogs all read me a
solution to my problems and escape from
reality
and the dog is memorable because it's so
[ __ ] over-the-top cartoonish it's not
a five but I do like the problems they
chose and again this is for kids but
let's let's close the street now boys I
had a great time I really enjoyed it
these are always fun for me to do these
where my favorite streams to do I love

zoomers can't watch a full
22 minute episode ah
they can't so we
have a genius plan here's what we'll do
we'll take
billions of dollars of investor money
and we'll make a bunch of 10-minute
episodes
that can be played on your phone
now let me show you again you might have
seen it in their ad but look
some include jblo and other people
mention it over and over
you can flip your phone and get a
different
screen the phone plays in vertical and
horizontal what a brilliant idea
what a brilliant idea
now let me talk to you let me talk to
you
about the two people making this claim
because as you heard from that intro
this was marketed at the younger
generation
the idea was that zoomers specifically
would be all over this largely because
of their attention span
let me talk to you about these two
people can i show
if you were thinking who's the right two
people
to really understand the zoomer mind who
could market to zoomers
who could know what they want who's
gonna be the person i want to trust
with my 1.7 billion dollars on this idea
let me tell you here's a face
you would pick first up right off the
bat okay
and that's jeffrey katzenberg
jeffrey katzenberg a man in his 60s
uh while he was he was he was founder of
dreamworks right
and dreamworks did hit the kids he did
found dreamworks all right
he has a pedigree he worked on uh
shrek he worked on shrek so actually
let me tell you maybe he does know a
[ __ ] thing or two about zoomers all
right
but he owned dreamworks when shrek was
approved to be created
shrek kung fu panda monsters vs aliens
okay he had been involved in these but
you know what he found a partner
he found a partner who knows business in
and out a partner who'd never failed
a partner who knows uh young teens even
better than he does
and that of course is meg whitman
meg whitman
meg whitton the former ceo of hp
how with packard if anyone knows what
the zoomers want
it's meg whitman she ran for governor of
california as a republican
uh didn't win and uh
and then decided to go and work
for quibby so these are the two people
who were promising investors that if you
give us nearly two billion
dollars we will guarantee you a big
success with the zoomers
we will guarantee it someone did an
interview with meg whitman
and asked what she watches what
entertainment she watches that makes her
qualified
and she said well you know i don't even
really watch
tv and they pressed her and said you
must watch something
you must watch something if you're going
to be doing this and she said well you
know my favorite thing
is history channel documentaries
you're the perfect person to be creating
a 10 minute show series
targeted at zoomers now i don't want to
spend the whole time
[ __ ] on the founding executives
because that's not the only reason
this thing failed these guys clearly
lacked foresight they clearly lacked any
kind of knowledge
about what they were doing it's a very
like i am a rich boomer
everything's worked out for me so far
how could this fail it's that kind of
mindset
they clearly were out of their depth
they clearly just thought if we throw
money at this problem
what could fail but that's not the only
problem all right
i think the main problem because again
what they basically did and let me
explain quibby is they took all this
money 1.7 billion dollars
and they went around to a lot of very
famous people uh
let me see if i can find some quibby ads
so sorry sir your table isn't quite
ready
it's fine dude do you know how long it's
gonna be just a quibby
mr chance the rapper mr the rapper
wow i only saw that 4 000 times
because i googled chance the rapper once
and the amount of money they spent on
marketing
is no joke it's no joke and literally
it's the one thing i give them some
ounce of credit for because
um a lot of business leaders skimp on
marketing and as a marketer i hate that
i want people to spend and video spends
no problem whatever i'm not trying i'm
not talking about my
twitch spend i'm just saying in general
when times are tough in a business
the first thing they cut is marketing
spend quibby did not do that
when times were tough at quibby they
threw more money at marketing
but the problem and this is the bold
take
people said all the ads were annoying oh
the stars weren't big enough oh the
shows weren't great
people watch crap shows all the time
here's the problem
here's what i believe is the fundamental
flaw of quibby here's the fundamental
flaw
when you're watching a crap show
a show you put on to pass the time a
show that you know isn't citizen kane
or isn't a deep thing you have to pay
attention to when you're watching a [ __ ]
show
in 2020 as a young person
what are you doing you're browsing your
[ __ ] phone at the same time you have
a second screen
experience zoomers are on their phone
they're never not on their phone they're
on their phone
while they watch the [ __ ] show if you're
making a [ __ ]
show they need to be able to watch their
phone quibby
for some fundamentally stupid reason
made the show take over your phone
and you could only watch it on mobile so
literally you have to watch
with perfect rapt attention chance the
rapper
try to be ashton kutcher there's nowhere
to go
i spent five by eight dollars i have to
i can't look anywhere
else nothing can distract me that's too
much pressure for a zoomer
even if it's only for 10 minutes zoomers
cannot handle that pressure
so those two things are the fundamental
problems
they don't understand how attention span
works
they needed this they need to be able to
switch back and forth it's the switching
back and forth that creates the
the ability to calm your mind that's
what zoomers use it for okay
it's not just a shorter episode secondly
they didn't understand their competitors
so their competitors were this
quibby was like look zoomers don't like
this stuff
actually zoomers love this stuff but
they thought they could do better they
thought hey
this stuff's all too long let's make
stuff like this
we'll put it on the phone that's where
they live and we'll make it better
better for zoomers and the problem was
their competition
was this
this and this was
so much better than anything
quibby had ever thought of ever
imagine short form quick videos
great for wasting time on your phone in
and out whenever you want
they don't even have to pay to make the
content the users make the content for
free
and it's just as funny it's in fact more
funny because 60 year old
[ __ ] white people aren't paying to
make it
this was the competition this was not
the competition
and also even if this was the
competition
you got beat because guess what
even though quibby wasted 1.7 billion
dollars prime video
spends like 10x that netflix spends
20 x that hulu spends about 5x that so
even if it was just
show for show all of these things spend
more
so there was never a chance in hell dude
quilby was outgunned from minute one and
they still threw away
1.7 billion dollars so but end of the
day this was the real problem
was they didn't fundamentally understand
how the phone attention span thing works
they didn't understand about the second
screen experience and they didn't
understand
they were competing from day one with
tick-tock which just did it better and
quicker and faster and cheaper uh
and it's sad it's sad because so many
people
lost money and people that worked there
lost jobs
and so the the the arrogance and the
idiocy of the two founders
just just wasted 1.7 billion dollars i
mean and quickly within six months
they wasted it and there's so much good
that could have been done with that or
so many smart businesses

The Rise of Computer-Generated Influencers. - YouTube
boys today is marketing money we'll get
to marketing money in a second i have a
topic i'm very interested in today
i am a marketer if you guys don't know
by trade by profession
and often in the course of my marketing
i will have to get influencers and
i came across an influencer she
was relatable okay
she was uh i mean let's be honest just
drop dead gorgeous
she was uh clever and witty
she was traveling a lot and i thought
man this is like a perfect brand
fit okay she loved gaming
and then i realized she
is not
real this is riot's newest influencer
self created from the ground up
seraphine timed
to the release of a new champion
in game timed to the world's performance
of kda
which she as part of her storyline
joined
this is her as a child wow look at this
she's had a backstory we can talk about
whether whether
or not it truly is working but from a
numbers plv
it is certainly interesting as a
marketer because her engagement numbers
right from the beginning were off the
charts and now she's getting
hundreds of thousands she's got 425
she's only been around for
a month or two i mean this is not very
long at all and a lot of female emperors
complain about always being judged in
their appearance
and so this is literally like a perfect
fake woman that has no
facial flaws and i saw in chat someone
said
could fit a quarter in her tooth gap lol
w
[Laughter]
like immediately like when i first
pulled up the [ __ ]
like the first instinct is to a roaster
that's my gamers that's the gamers i
know why
would a brand want to do this what
what's the benefit because your first
reaction a lot of you
is creepy this is creepy right that's
the why not
they're cheaper significantly
significantly cheaper now let's say you
wanted to get someone with 500 000
followers on instagram
to do a complete social takeover
basically promoting a new champion for
uh two months it's absolutely it's
astronomically expensive
but if you own the influencer you can
build it right in
they don't miss deliverables
they don't promise they'll do something
in a contract and then get lazy
influencers are notoriously unreliable
influencers wake up at noon
if not one and they're hungover and they
don't want to think of a clever tweet
for your brand
so they just [ __ ] one out they can be
everywhere
at once do you need them to be at a
mcdonald's
there they are the travel costs
of getting a bunch of influencers out to
shanghai
paying for their hotel paying for their
flights paying for them to do social
media for those days paying for them to
talk about your brand
are expensive the conduit of fame
is not going on a talk show or being in
a movie
you can be famous through
essentially static images and that's
easy to do you can make a
generate a static image that looks
almost real right here they
don't have controversial opinions
they have very brand safe opinions
in fact all they care about
is your brand and a little tip geico
could help you save on homeowners
insurance
cookies and things that make them
relatable
things that are brand safe let's say you
want
the massive brand reach of a logan paul
and you spend a lot of money
to get logan paul to say some nice stuff
about your brand
and the next day he decides i'm gonna
film a dead body
in japan in the suicide forest
well that's tough now currently i'll say
digital influencers are more interesting
to brands
than they are to users users are still
really wary
because the tech isn't quite there and
we're still all a little creeped out
about it
but we're less creeped out than we were
last year and that's what's important to
look at
and i think what made it so interesting
and
uncomfortable to people is that they
dove in
on the concept of making her
have mental health issues
to make her more relatable to gen z that
was a bridge too far for a lot of people
self-care together with her and her cat
now i don't know how much self-care you
need
she also talks about you know before
performances
being extremely stressed and depressed
and down and you know what's weird
is there was two reactions to this that
let me that confirmed to me
that this is gonna happen one was
disgust i mean there's people that were
like really pissed about this
there was people going hey don't
appropriate mental health
to sell skins and there was
other people a large number of people in
the comments
who said who responded to those people
and said don't ruin the immersion
get the [ __ ] out of here if you don't
like it leave i like this
let's just pull up like honda honda's
got a million followers right
but what do they get on the average post
14 retweets 100 likes right
i mean this is crap they don't they have
a million followers but
nobody cares now people are saying
you'll never touch her or meter like
what the [ __ ]
but the truth is the truth that is
enabling this
is that the nature of celebrity has
changed with social media and the fact
is
you probably aren't going to meet who
whatever
human being you're simping for on
twitter or instagram
or or fanning for not even simping
simping is a
an extreme if you're subbed to me you're
not meeting me we're probably not
meeting
technically even if i wasn't human it
wouldn't change your interaction
i'm i'm convinced this stuff will work
what i'm not convinced is uh that
we've found the right way to do it yet i
don't think seraphine is a
a perfect model the secret to good skin
is love
the secret to good skin that's the
secret to your good skin
seraphine is it love
that's the secret i thought it was the
fact that it's
fake so because it's the beginning
because there's so much more coming
i decided i've gotta get in on this
it would be my honor for you guys to
meet
[ __ ] i didn't do it right bergsy
hey guys hey
it's me bergsy
oh i'm a little nervous to be all
there's so many people in chat
i don't know if this is relatable to you
guys but sometimes i get a little
nervous in front of crowds
you know what made me feel better is
like a delicious combo meal
lol i mean oh god i said lol oh my god
as long as i say it out loud you know
like i i don't even type it i say it
if you guys want to follow my twitter um
you know i just tweet like little
thoughts on there or whatever
i've been working on this tweet you know
about how i kind of feel down today but
maybe like a burger will cheer me up
well like what do you guys think about
that what's the secret to my great skin
oh really you think that that's so kind
to you actually i think my secret is
it's gonna sound corny but it's love
you know it's like that's the difference
is love you know what i hate
well there's two things i hate one are
vegetarians am i right and two
teachers oh my god
parents and teachers i'm gonna give it
back to atrialk but
find me on my twitter at altriac
a lot of this generally creeps me out
generally when i see
you know the picture of a digital
influencer as a little girl
all this stuff i get a little creeped
out it's like man you're really dealing
with depression in a fake way
and then i remembered in the shower
today wait a minute i've fallen for this
before
like this is something i've fallen for
and i realized
that i love bojack horseman
bojack horseman's twitter is entirely in
character
as a depressed alcoholic horse
and i lo i thought i mean the the show
is obviously great that's different
what i'm saying is i was impressed by
this marketing i don't talk about
feelings usually but i just found out
that i
look at this and i didn't think this was
weird or creepy because i love the show
so the end of the day i can't be too
hypocritical
no look it's all weird line right
because
um if a character in a show
has emotions you're not like oh my god
you're acting
okay you don't really have those
emotions you're an actor playing a
character that's gross
when you bring it into the quote-unquote
real world with social media
as a character we feel like a line has
been crossed
we feel like there's this is not what
we're comfortable doing
and especially because at the end of the
day these are not art projects these are
commerce projects these are all designed
to sell more products
i i do not think they'll be more fake
and versus the real ones no i don't
think we're anywhere close to fake news
there's
outnumbering real ones but i think we
are close to a world
where we have a fake influencer who has
the reach and impact of the top
real influencers at the end of the day
it's just
it's exploiting relatability
to sell product which has always been
uh part of the marketing wheelhouse is
just using technology
social media and uh
and some new ideas and marketing to push
it a step further than we might be
comfortable with
the uncanny valley is as you get closer
to looking like a real human
it gets more and more creepy so for
example a pixar character
is not creepy because you can tell it's
not human and you can still relate to it
but as you get closer looking real
people get more creeped out
that's the uncanny valley the line for
me has been like when they're very
self-aware and kind of humorous about it
then it's like all right we all get the
joke this is funny and i think when they
try to be super authentic
super relatable this is a human that
feels like it's
it's trying to exploit vulnerable people
that's what it feels like to me
now that being said none of this applies
to bergsy who really is struggling and
having some tough times right now and
needs your support so
um please if you can donate or you know
what
all subs today all subs today go to the
burgzy fund
he's actually trying to get into a
school of the arts to pursue his passion
for painting
for berksy an example you're seeing
right now is v tubers so i showed you
you know burgz is not a youtuber but
he's real burger but
v tubers are a slightly different thing
they're not solving the same problem
they're still human beings they still
have the opinions problem they solve the
cost problem
v tubers really solves the problem of uh
there is a limited supply
of people who look amazing on camera
and there is a larger supply of people
who are
entertaining enough v tubers is like a
technological solution to bridge that
gap you can almost say the first v tuber
is docker disrespect
doctor's respect is not his irl person
he is a character right because he can
do the speed violence momentum because
he can be
extra macho because he can say all the
things that like if he was
100 real on stream he couldn't and if he
was just himself
i don't think it would be as relatable
or interesting
to the audience he's going for it's like
wwe's a character
too often and for such a long time
people have been treated unfairly and
in some cases even hurt by others
because of the color of their skin
this stuff isn't easy to talk about
which is exactly why we have to talk
about it
it's a tough conversation but i'm glad
we're having it
damn dude even in the fictional world
she's getting talked over
uh this is this is uncomfortable because
i and so many other black people have to
deal with racism
all well you don't because you're not
real
i don't like it i don't want to watch
more of this this makes me
it's it's really shocking to me that got
through
the rounds of approvals it takes to make
something like this
thank you
THE CONSOLE WAR HAS BEGUN. - YouTube
what's up boys welcome to another
marketing monday
today we have a couple times we have
quite a few topics today
but the number one and most important
is that every console is watching this
week xbox
and ps5 both dropped this week i've been
looking into the
trends data i've been looking into the
sales data i've been looking into the
pre-orders
uh i've got their earliest commercials i
figure we might make it bigger
than all of this this console and we
should watch some of the best console
ads of all time
so i found a few and i'm going to give a
prediction at the end
of who i honestly think is going to win
based on everything i've looked into
so castle wars um let's set where we are
which is where we are in the world
tomorrow as in uh basically now in some
countries
the xbox is available followed in two
days by the ps5
at which point people will begin to buy
them and by early next year they should
actually have supplied enough stock
that we can see who's really winning
this is the australian countdown
to the release of the xbox
sorry to interrupt but if this was a
real console war
if we really wanted to get hot with it
this would be the perfect time for like
a
tactical missile to hit the [ __ ]
let's suppose that you were able every
night to dream any dream you wanted to
dream
jeez and that you could have the power
within one night to dream 75 years of
time
and you would naturally by the way on
this adventure of dreams
fulfill all your wishes let's have a
dream which isn't under control
[Music]
i'm sorry i i'm as excited as the next
guy about the future of gaming
obviously and i understand when you mark
it you got to be a little bit bigger
than
you got to be larger than life but
you're not inventing [ __ ] cure for
cancer here
i'm not dreaming for 75 years to think
of the xbox series x okay
and then you would get more and more
adventurous
and you would make further and further
out gambles as to what you would dream
oh and finally you would dream
where you are now confirmed it'll take
75 years for halo to release
yeah they went all out dawg
[Music]
this looks expensive all right i would
have taken this money and gotten one
more launch game just one more game for
the [ __ ] launch
because we're gonna talk about it in a
bit and there's not that many games
for this launch it's almost there
okay mixer two
[Laughter]
imagine they do all this the watch mixer
do the best and the brightest of
microsoft have been thinking
how can we win this war ninja comes out
again
second time's a charm oh man there you
have it
okay that was it that was it that was it
damn they went all out that's i mean uh
outdoor advertising you know it's a lot
that's a lot cooler than a [ __ ]
billboard
huh so it's launched so so officially as
of uh now it's uh it's available in most
countries
in that time zone and will be here by
tomorrow sony follows two days behind
and they have had some commercials of
their own
i was really thinking about who's gonna
win this console war who's got the best
marketing who's got the best
partnerships who's got the best games
but then i realized none of that
mattered because sony had found
a partner that was too strong to stop
the mcdonald's guy they got the guy from
the mcdonald's thing oh [ __ ]
that's a game changer that's the face
you want
when i'm playing ps5 that i want to feel
like i'm
mid ejaculation travis scott official
creative partner i don't know exactly
what that means i don't know how he's
i don't know he's factoring in but he's
the official creative partner ps5
as they've been rolling out more ads
travis scott's in all of them either as
a voice or in person
the top comment the top comment at this
point the koben vaccine gonna have a
travis scott rollout
now let me tell you i'm not uh i i do
think that this is not
the most inspired brand partnership you
know i'm not
but again i didn't think cactus jack uh
perhaps he's just that popular all right
maybe he's just got it like that
and so maybe it's a right call on sony's
part so i don't know if hinging
everything of ps5 which is a big brand
that everyone likes
on travis scott is that great but
we'll see so one thing i found out is uh
but only let me give you a quick uh
really basic graph
this is how much sony's spending on
marketing they they're writing about
3000 ads a year
this is how much xbox is spinning on
marketing they're running about 5600
okay so just so you know xbox is
spinning about almost two to one
what i'm trying to say is uh the story
of this console war so far
has been sony with a little bit more
knowledge
on what people want and microsoft with
infinitely deep pockets
so that's the story that like this is
the narrative of this console war
so let me let me show you their first ad
exploration it's in our dna
to push past every frontier
we want to see what's never been seen
there are no limits to where we'll go
we are all explorers
and there are new worlds to explore
this is like prime steve
jobs level pretentiousness
none of this has to do with consoles
dude none of this
i think both both of the companies are
getting way ahead of themselves
on just what they're selling even if
this ad inspired me
it would not inspire me to go sit in my
basement and play ps5
i'm not exploring the world i'm not this
guy i'm not
diving under seas i'm not i'm not her do
you think she grinded
84 hours of rocket league on her ps5 no
she studied i don't want to study show
me what gamers do
dude you know imagine like it was kids
at the beginning
all playing games on different sony
consoles and then growing up and doing
cool things
that would be a lie obviously a lie
but still that's fine you can lie in an
ad that would be kind of interesting or
like if it showed
for example i mean you have travis scott
as your creative partner he's doing the
narration
he's a huge fan of playstation showed
travis scott as a kid with his
playstation
and then he grew up and became a big
star do you know what i'm saying like
that's an ad
there's something there this ad is not
it all right so
uh but wait wait wait we gotta counter
[Music]
it
what's good hey
i know this is
[Music]
[Applause]
so this is a better ad but i think you
all noticed
these ads are very similar i think
they're like their marketing teams are
copying each other back and forth i
think
which by the way even though the xbox ad
is better
you know a general heuristic of
marketing is that if you are the
underdog
which microsoft is going into this
generation they're the underdog that's
xbox one 52.8
that's switch 63 yeah it's not close
and if you're the underdog in marketing
you have to find a way
to be distinct you cannot yes and you
cannot be uh
you can't even be as good you have to
find a way
to be somehow stand out or be distinct
otherwise
people just generally people by default
will go to whatever this
the bigger one is copying the marketing
even if there's a slightly better is not
the way i i would go i think they need
to find a way to stand out a little bit
more
and usually consoles do that through
exclusives but xbox has not been doing
that so they're they're really leaning
into other things they're leading into
the promise of halo
and they're leaning into uh the game
pass which is amazing
like all of the ads we're looking at are
not
really among the greats so
we're gonna look at some of the best
console war ads of all time and we're
gonna start
with the all-time greatest
[Music]
you telling me in the 90s you're not
copping the genesis after this
when you can get joe montana football
for free
genesis does what ninten don't
this is how you stand out i mean it's a
little direct
and this sort of style of advertising
where you basically say your
competitor's name
has fallen out of vogue uh i like this
directness and this is one of the
greatest ads in the console where
history
this is the sales of every game console
by year
so just to give you a quick primer right
so we're in the console wars here
atari first console that doesn't [ __ ]
suck
and television absolutely dog and then
in around 83 i'm gonna tell you right
around here
around here in 83 there is a massive
crash in the industry
all of these consoles were churning out
so much
dog [ __ ] that the american public and
the people at large
basically revolted and the 83 holiday
season
bought almost no games and so there was
a general sense among the public
that video games were stupid or bad
quality or a rip off and so nintendo had
the strategy of that nintendo sticker
which is one of the greatest pieces of
marketing of all time this thing
this thing was what nintendo did
to stand out now it seems a little hokey
now
but in 83 it was something where
nintendo would
would rigorously vet third-party games
to be of a certain standard so you can
see right around 84 yeah
right look right around 84 the nes
starts taking off
oh my god oh my god the speed the speed
and then right around 89 89 is when
nintendo had
absolute dominance in the industry this
is when
in 89 maybe early 90s when nintendo
became a synonym for game console
they had won so hard that the average
person would say
nintendo was just video games the super
nes comes out
big success game boy massive success
sega tried to go for everything they
tried to come out nintendo on both
[ __ ] turfs
and they really got destroyed on the
game boy
because game boy got tetris and that
wiped the floor with everything tetra
sold a gazillion copies
when two companies are going
head-to-head and spending a lot of money
to win a war
you guys generally win so this is a good
sign
then uh 95 i think
there was gonna be a cd-rom add-on
to the super nes and it fell through
hard
it fell through in a way that made sony
actually really mad at nintendo
and so sony to sort of not waste all the
time they'd spent on the cd-rom drive
and also get back at nintendo launched
the playstation
n64 was super late to this party so
playstation even though nintendo by the
way
you have to understand nintendo's
arrogance before the position launched
nintendo [ __ ]
ruled the world they turned down sony
and left
and they thought they could take their
time on the n64 they could not
with a with a cd you could just throw
everything on there and suddenly
places starts to take off oh by the way
uh
can i get a can i get a salute for sega
who launched the flop of a saturn and
then sort of
faded into a relevance little do you
know
how i'm breaking while you so
playstation goes
goes absolutely astronomical it's
already now it's already now the
best-selling console of all time
if you don't count game boy sony
dominates this generation the ps2
generation is like
it's not close gamecube as you noticed
is not even on this chart
i remember as a kid getting made fun of
for having a gamecube because it was
like the little kids
one like the ps2 and xbox were like the
cool one
and the gamecube had the little handle
and it was purple
like the barney and i remember i would
get on the game fax message boards and i
would talk [ __ ] and be like you know
what
game is actually gangster is [ __ ] gang
keeps cool cool as hell
and uh other than that gamecube flopped
essentially
playstation bs2 sold an absolute
gargantuan number look at this
it's now the best-selling console of all
time there's another throwback story so
again i was uh
i was always been a closet gamer and i
remember i would go home and like argue
about console wars on
forums and [ __ ] so right around 2006
this video popped up by the way
the code name for the wii was the
revolution and i was like dude i can't
wait
the [ __ ] revolution that's so bad ass
the revolution's coming
it's about to change the game i'm about
to be able to finally fight back to
these xbox and ps2 nerds
okay watch this
and then it shows this and you're like
whoa whoa
i love this game yes nintendo recognizes
this is one of the greatest gifts they
ever made i'm so excited
[Music]
nintendo revolution and there's a zero
zero one
and then it goes to six and seven
[Music]
no and my
jaw hit the floor as a kid
i mean i was like no
you're joking no
a castle built out of other castles
the power the raw power
i mean i i just remember like
realizing there was a god when i saw
this on like
terrible internet
oh my god and then it goes on
to show the whole thing is like a helmet
you put on
by the way if you have any idea of what
technology was like in 2005
this was not possible not even close
right not even close
but i was like oh my god they did it
turns out this is not real this is what
the new mario's supposed to look like
this is the new mario
this is the launch title for the
revolution
look at the graphics oh my god
look at this cursed mario
oh but i believed
and then i wanted to know that
nintendo is working on our next system
and that system will create a gaming
revolution a gaming revolution
we've got one
again they had a different they actually
were so smart as a marketer
the wii was genius okay the wii
did so many things to say this is not
for teenage boys
this is for families but as a teenage
boy was like
damn dude you guys know in japan like i
may not know this
we kind of sounds like wee-wee which
sounds like
penis and people might make fun of me
for that
that was all the [ __ ] kids were
thinking it was such it was just like
teenagers are that dumb dude anyway it
turns out that we was quite good it
turns out the way was quite good
so the ds comes out does super duper
well wow this explains why every zoomer
remembers the ds look at the look at the
time stamp and look at how much it's
selling
if you were born in 2000 yeah that's it
the ds is your is your
childhood console is it pass
no
[Music]
holy moly i did not know the ds did that
well the best-selling console ever
you had a psp can we i don't know when
i'll fit this in so i have to fit it in
psp ads
i can't i'm playing nut but there's
portable nut what
yeah it's a nut you can play with
outside
psp it's like a nut you can play with
outside
imagine that now dude imagine that now
with
uh meme culture but at the time you
would just see it on loop on comedy
central you see this ad all the [ __ ]
time
what squirrel please you have about as
much skills as a chipmunk
yo mama's a chipmunk oh no
he got denied just like you get denied
by the ladies
shoot if i had a ship like that the
girls would be all over me like salt on
a peanut
hells yeah pills yeah psp
who wrote that who wrote that ad
please drag them out to the square and
hang them i swear to god who wrote that
ad
denied like you get denied by the ladies
this is terrible
like salt on a peanut yeah
this is a terrible ad dude with the
weird actions
and oh my god anyway psp was
lost that war and i think thank god i
hope it was because of these ads
oh dust ball no way you got a new psp
with the crazy white screen lcd
what is this sony movies music photos
and you can like play your just imagine
i mean from a marketing pob
it's just not even because it's like
it's kind of weirdly racist and i
it's bad on a lot of levels but on a
marketing level okay
what are the what is the advantage of
the psp it's high-tech
it's glossy it's sexy it's a high-end
consumer device
if they had marketed the psp like the
iphone
they could have sold a bunch of them and
instead
they went for this route oh man this is
like totally chick magnet stuff
yeah i'd be watching a movie in a
laundromat and i see the sad girl and
you go
hey girl why you so sad and she says i
lost my favorite song
then i go don't be sad i got a song for
you and then i play like a really happy
song and then she gets so happy that she
started
dancing with me and then i put bubbles
in the washing machine and it become a
phone show
and it'd be like so cool that people
would take pictures and download them to
the psp
and girls will be begging to be in the
pictures with me going oh dospel you're
like a little slice of head
it's still going away the internet on my
website super hotdog.com
and then every girl would download my
pictures to the psp and they would want
to eat the screen
yeah the prank i actually can't i can't
i can't i can't i can't i can't i can't
i can't
oh my god sony paid a marketing agency a
ton of money for this
and then saw it and said let's spend a
ton more money
putting it on tv continuing because
we're almost caught up
ps3 like i said when a company is on top
they usually make bad decisions and when
they are struggling for market share and
trying to to win a competition
they make good decisions if you i mean
you guys remember the launch
the essence of the playstation dna is
real change
and the consumers are ready the um
stages of the game will also be based on
famous battles which took actually took
place in ancient japan
so here's this giant enemy crab
this is like one of the first really big
viral
game memes giant enemy crab ridge racer
599 us dollars they announced 599 usd
and everyone dipped the ridge racer
thing
dead silent crowd he's like real tracer
rich racer trying to get everyone
excited no one's
talking they talked about their launch
game with historically accurate japan
and then it's giant enemy crab
ridge racer playstation 3 will retail
for
599 us dollars and we're certainly not
interested in gimmicks
phil today we have the eye of judgment
see i place a card
into the screen onto the screen here and
a monster
instantiates i don't remember the
yu-gi-oh card instantiating
and i certainly didn't remember them
trying to pitch
you using your psp as a rear-view mirror
while trying to drive a ridge rate
that's
crazy what a useless
feature a lot of great new features for
this game
features as real-time weapon change
with playstation real-time weapon change
how did they lose one thing i've noticed
despite who i predict will win this is
setting itself
up to be one of the closest console wars
in the history we just went through all
those console wars
i don't think any of them were as primed
at the launch
to be as close and competitive as this
one is i did a lot of research
on which console was gonna win i looked
at sales data i looked at
trends data i looked at social media
data then i saw a tweet that was so
powerful i saw this tweet the only
superstar here is xbox
with a chad xbox holding an xbox
being surrounded by women holding his
giant
game pass nut sack and i thought wait a
minute
and then i noticed the console war
is really raging entirely in twitter
comments on xbox
is and sony's accounts everything sony
posts
xbox fans post memes on this guy who had
a travis scott
avatar this guy said that's it that
seals the deal i'm no longer a position
gamer
i've been a ps fan since 2001 and have
taken l's after l's
i will no longer buy a ps5 and once that
buy an xbox
where they actually know how to make
great exclusives and a great next-gen
console
he posted on literally everything they
posted this one you know
after i saw that first one with the
giant game pass nut sack i thought
it's a wrap sony loses but then they
fired back with this
the xbox flop of the year edition halo
infinite disappointment series l so now
i don't know who's gonna win
the memes are so strong who the [ __ ] is
gonna win this console war
both of them don't have uh really a lot
of games for the launch to be honest
at launch there's miles morales in the
ps5
and then a bunch of non-exclusives here
is the timeline
here is now end of 2020.
so these are the launch titles for both
of them uh watchdogs legion as you can
see is non-exclusive
basically there's three titles that
sony's competing with for launch
guess what happens right around here
when their biggest and by far most hyped
and most important exclusive drops
you can actually buy one of these in a
store
this thing and this thing are both
selling out
doesn't matter if you have great games
doesn't matter if you have [ __ ] games
they're gonna sell out
so if you had a really great title
that was exclusive and you don't have a
lot of exclusives on this side of the
field
you don't really want that title to be
available at launch
because when a game releases is the peak
of the most interest you're gonna get so
if you
release a game here when nobody can buy
the console anyway
you can't increase the maximum it's
selling out no matter what but right
around here
when consoles are coming back being able
to drop a title like this from a
marketing pov
it's actually extremely intelligent in
my mind
to put halo which is basically xbox's
only killer app
what if the game is bad they're [ __ ]
halo infinite being a good game is so
so so so important for xbox
now what i've done here is i went
through
and i checked the google trends this is
a rough heuristic
but which countries uh xbox was more
exciting
more more anticipated in and which
countries sony's participated in
what what is the early demand looking
like afghanistan
area more excited for the xbox mexico
mexico is more excited for the xbox
whatever country this is is more
exciting for the xbox
and then that's it
that is all of it
well let me just say based on what i'm
seeing
the demand for the ps5 going into this
holiday season
is extremely favored over the xbox that
if i'm predicting a winner
today what i would say is sony will edge
this one out
i think sony has a bit more demand a bit
more excitement
and a bit more consumer energy so based
on all that based on how i've seen
almost all the reviews that came out
this week
put them about equal but the theme of
all this is to say
that it's gonna be a real war which is
incredibly good for the consumer
so if you're interested in if you
haven't been a console gamer
or you are thinking about getting a
console this generation is the time to
jump in i think
i think you're gonna get a lot of value
a lot of bang for your buck no matter
which side you choose
[Music]
you
THE ORIGINAL ATRIOC GAMBIT - YouTube
oh oh my god should i tell
i i have enough people here that i want
to show you guys something
i wanted i want to show you guys
something
it's proof that i'm the greatest
marketer of all time
oh i remembered this i was going to save
this
i'm going to show you a college
marketing project i did
i had to i had to literally i had a
message
a guy i hadn't spoken to in 10 years
i messaged this guy who was a in my
group project
i haven't spoken to him in probably 10
years
and i asked him if he still had for like
i said
you know this is a huge long shot i know
we haven't spoken do you still have
the deck we made for this marketing
project and he's like yeah
man i do by the way i saw you on an
nvidia ad pog and i was like
yeah dude that's dope the year is 20
probably 12.
i am 20
years old probably i in general spent
most of my college time at asu
either drinking or playing league of
legends
that was my two activities and so i
missed a lot of classes
most classes i found to be quite boring
and then this class came along
this marketing 462 class and this class
is a competition there's only like
20 students in the class they are broken
up
into teams of three or four and they are
they have to start a company
where they compete against each other in
a marketplace selling laptops
it was like a complete marketing game
designed from the ground up
okay 50 of your grade was determined
by your performance relative to others
in this class which means like if you
are last place you almost can't pass
which means the stakes are high i'm
sitting up i'm interested i'm listening
and i get paired off into a team of
these
two people the first one his name was
eric i'm not gonna tell you his last
name
this kid was the biggest business school
stoner at asu that i could imagine
this kid was clearly from day one
not going to do any work on this project
the other kid was named jason
he was you know sure a guy he had
glasses
he was a little nerdy but he was smart
okay i liked his energy
okay he had good energy and so me and
jason
formed a partnership we shook hands and
we said
we are going to win this thing we
started a company called
enron2 now if you guys don't know enron
this is a little more of a dated
reference now i don't know if zoomers
know enron but
uh for a millennial in business school
as a kid you would have heard of enron
it was like one of the biggest
scandals of all time in business history
it was like a gigantic flop
these are all these other people in
class there was compute you
some douchebags there was pear tech
these three girls who wanted to be
apples so bad
they call themselves pear tech how
original ladies
enron 2 that's your boy and jason and
eric literally
barely even show up to class dude eric
hi all the time
love eric by the way in a true example
of nepotism
we in an enron style we made eric our
cfo
our chief financial officer uh zmc
computer systems
these were the nerdiest kids in class
and the most likely to be our
competition
you have to target certain markets so
they made the markets the mercedes
market which is like high-end
the innovator market people who want
cutting-edge technology in laptops the
traveler market so like business people
who want like an expensive laptop for
flights
the workhorse market people who use
laptops every single day
and then the cost cutter market people
who want a cheap laptop
just to watch anything this was our
presentation we had to give to the whole
class
and this presentation was very
contentious
for reasons you will soon see people
were not clapping
at the end of our presentation and i
will show you why
every class was considered a quarter so
the entire semester was like i don't
know i don't know
uh 10 quarters 10 10 classes by quarter
3
we had as you can see in this graph 60
of the travel market
we were traveler only company and we
made fat
margins because we had almost all the
traveler market and then i had this
quote
which i don't know why i wanted to sound
like napoleon
but i said to jason and i said in our
prospectus
we're gonna fight for every single
market in every single city
and i put it in quotes in this
presentation like a douchebag all right
zmc was going for innovator and traveler
uh
compute u was going for workhorse and
cost cutter i put boxes of color like to
see which ones are going around each one
one more time enron two
was going for all of them
enron 2 wanted everything this is where
i know that i invented the atriac gambit
before anyone else
because in this presentation i say the
quarter six gambit
the quarter six gambit this is from 2011
2012 and i wrote the quarter six gambit
dude
i've been doing gambits for [ __ ] ever
that's why i was so [ __ ] happy
to find this presentation because it
proved that i've been gambiting
for as long as i can remember dude this
was my
favorite moment in all of college and
that's sad to say
because i had sex in college
sensibly i met good friends in college
but really this moment shines through
we lost 3.7 million dollars in quarter
six
it's a disaster you are scored based on
how much money
you make we lost money because look at
this
minus 12 million dollars on research and
development costs
by the way i overrode both my partners
this is us we were making the most money
and then in quarter uh
six we were losing ground they were dmc
was starting to catch up and i was like
dude
[ __ ] this jason eric go get high
jason i don't want to just be first or
second
i want to [ __ ] crush this game jason
i want to win this game
so bad the teacher remembers it i want
to win
jason he's like dude we're fine our
grade is set
we are already in top two we just coast
keep doing what we're doing we're going
to be fine
and i was like jason i have the password
to the account
i am going to do this and i
and i went in and i i spent all of our
money and more i went into debt
i spent all the money the game would
maximal allow me to spend
and i got this warning i took a
screenshot of it your firm's
independent auditor has noted you intend
to spend 12 million dollars on new
business development investments your
auditor must warn you that you're
approaching the limit of what makes good
business sense
and by the way if this didn't work out
we would go from a great grade to a
failing grade
jason was not super happy but i [ __ ]
ran it dude
i ran the quarter six gambit i spent on
everything i spent all night not playing
league for once
and i looked at what every competitor
was doing in every market and i tried to
buy better r
d than them in all fields which cost us
an absurd amount of money i also opened
up
stores in new york at all the expensive
cities take a look at this graph
when i remove the black bar on quarter
seven
[Laughter]
oh yes oh
yes dude the quarter sticks gambit all
those kids woke up
to check the status of their laptops and
it was like
holy what the [ __ ] we went from like 40
to 10 market share like overnight
enron went from being like a pretty good
travel company to
the laptop company in every market okay
we put a laptop in every pot
once we started to take the lead and we
got closer to the end of the semester
other teams started trying to to learn
from us because they wanted to get
better grades
and so they they started to look at what
we were doing
which is why i had carefully named
all of our products incorrectly now let
me give you an example
our neo travel gold and our travel x pro
laptop
were not our traveler laptops those were
our laptops for targeting cost cutter
[Laughter]
i had an excel sheet showing what all
the names really targeted
that i would use and we kept all our
older brands so we
we kept releasing new brands with every
r d but we kept the old ones around
just to steal more market share so we
were competing against ourself
so we had to make this slide because it
was demanded by the
actual teacher of the class this was
actually i remember talking to teacher
and he was like
you you have to you you have to credit
some other people you have to so we had
to do this biggest threat slide
let me be clear that there were no
threats to enron two
okay we were a total domination of the
marketplace
i put leapfrog the competition because
they
they came in and had one quarter of
success in traveler the very next
quarter we put them almost entirely out
of business
by the way this is the one quarter i
could find where we didn't have a
dominant market share in one
category they had one and then we
ruthlessly went after him but anyway i
had to give him the credit for this
leapfrog
so this is where jason came in and this
is where jason and a good data person
really makes marketing shine jason made
this
graph and we used this to literally
determine
on a game level what stuff was most
valuable
like an actual match-up chart and we
used this to
crush competitors in the most efficient
way so
it really was optimal and so this is my
favorite slide of all
because at the end this is our
cumulative score we wrote this down
our cumulative score was 291 everyone
else combined was 99
and i put this in a slide that i showed
in front of the entire class
we had to sit there and look them in the
eye and look around
and show this and talk about how good
our company was doing
we crushed them dude by quarter eight
it was an absolute laughing stock we had
like 70 80
market share of every category anyway we
got
such a high score that we unlocked
a castle in the alps and the instructor
said he'd never
seen the castle before
this is in the game the game gave you
this castle in the alps
which was such a flex dude
oh my god that felt good dude
ah but the funniest part was
i think this slide we had to have
eric reid eric who had done
eric what not even logged into the game
to be dead honest

What's the catchiest Commercial Jingle of all time? - YouTube
today's marketing monday is about
jingles
the best part of waking up
is marketing monday on your stream
maybe need some work and for that reason
i have created something quite special
a marketing monday jingle
tier list okay wait i need to move my
camera a little bit
we gotta get that clean for the intro so
everybody pog again
and for that i've created something
special a marketing monday
jingles tier
we are going to find collectively with
your votes
and my knowledge the greatest marketing
and the worst
marketing jingles of all time first of
all we're gonna talk about
what makes a good jingle and to do that
we have a special guest who i personally
invited
this guy hey
walt in your opinion what makes a
successful jingle
oh hey truck uh happy to tell you that
in a few seconds
right after you get some water it's not
walt disney
i didn't you think walt disney
came back from the dead and is black is
that what you think is
and i got him for my show in the name of
the
company business i always talk about
this
this is not even a this is not even a
jingle thing
you need to have your name front and
center people forget
so much of what they see in a commercial
you've got to make a remember it's about
your brand
there's so many commercials that are
funny and entertaining and everyone's
like wow i don't remember who that was
for
it's so important so putting it in your
jingle very important
if you can mention maybe two to three of
those things
that is the absolute perfect and most
powerful jingle
so to be clear though i mean he's right
but it can't be any two it's not it's
not like you can pick any of these you
have to have number one
it's like saying your commercial can be
dog [ __ ] but if you have
the name and the call to action and the
positioning you have to have number one
and you really have to have number two
so really you're just trying to get
these in order
if your jingle isn't catchy the whole
thing is moot
it has to be catchy and then from there
you try to fit in as much as you can to
help your brand
the use of simple advertising jingles
actually started all the way back in the
15th and 16th centuries
and i was there and i remember they
weren't that good
back in the 15th century the jingles
were dog dude
they've gotten so much better breakfast
cereal titan general mills had been
planning to end production of its weedy
cereal brand
in its last effort to resurrect the
brand the company launched the nation's
first
stand-alone commercial jingle crazy that
they're talking about
a last-ditch effort to resurrect the
brand in 1926
and wheaties still [ __ ] going strong
that's pretty impressive won't you
try with these
[Music]
the tone of the barbershop style for
wheat is the best food of
man all right i gotta review it i didn't
i didn't want to start this early we
have to review it
oh my god you think that's s t or dude
let me play it again just so we're all
on the same page while we're voting
so let's see how effective it was but
the promo worked like
magic saving the wheaties brand from
being killed off entirely
asked here asked here baby
asked here baby that's effective that's
moving units someone said i feel like i
have so many ads in my brain but i
rarely buy anything in the ads so to be
clear
and i've talked about this on stream
before but it's really important most
people seem to think
that if an ad doesn't get you to buy the
thing immediately
then it has failed if i watch a car ad
and i don't go buy a car that ad failed
that's not really the point the point is
to
if you are a car buyer or if ever in
your life you are searching for
car insurance or whatever to have in
your consideration set
this brand so if i'm not hungry for
cereal
but i see a wheaties ad and then later
i'm hungry for cereal
i want wheaties to be one of the choices
we don't keep very many choices in our
head
it's too much work we only usually have
one or two or three that we like okay
and so getting into that consideration
set is very important it's the goal of
marketing
i'm not gonna run the pole for that
pepsi ad it was bad
it doesn't have the same iconic you guys
remember that
okay if you remember that pepsi ad tell
me the lyrics right now
something about a nickel pepsi cola
something
you thought it was coca-cola all right
well that's just dumb
you thought dog it was five seconds ago
and it said pepsi
i ca that's not on me that's not on them
that's one of you man if you thought
that was a coke ad
i'm taking a banana and i've come to say
bananas have to ripen in a certain way
and when they're flicked with brown and
have a
golden hue bananas taste the best and
are the
best for you i i feel like i shouldn't
have to say this
but everyone in chat saying she's very
hot and sex sells
i don't think that was the point of this
ad i think that is your cracked out
zoomer brains
i'm pretty sure at the time when they
watched this they weren't like oh man
that is a sexy banana
i don't think they were going for sex
cells she doesn't have
anything that would really other than
the fact that she is
female and i've become i think that's it
she's got a woman's voice and you
depraved toph came in and says i'm
trying to [ __ ] a banana
so in front of my friends ladies and
gentlemen
i guess i i was trying i thought i was
blaming it all on zoomers but
it's older than me so i guess it's just
you know what it's not a generational
thing all right we can all come together
and
uh okay we put this in b that makes
sense all right so keep going let's keep
going i like to
teach the world due to its increasing
popularity one of the greatest ads of
all time
it's the end credits to mad men for a
reason i mean it's one of the most
impactful ads
and both times people listened as it
climbed to the top of the charts
coca-cola dude that's a that's a
marketer's dream
you come up with an a song for your ad
and it charts number one i gotta make a
frames with game song
frames win games
so get out there and
play because you've got to
get a nvidia
gpu that's here that's where you guys
think are you guys making us here
you think that'll chart chills bro
check my arm goose bumps
i hated that ad it's one of the most
shameless ads of all time
i hate that ad and also it's aged quite
poorly of michael jackson dancing with a
bunch of kids
but even outside of that from a
marketing pov i hate that ad
people are actually able to skip over
commercials that's a problem
now you have uh maybe more content on
youtube where you're not watching you
know
hours of tv and if you're watching
youtube content right now why don't you
hit that subscribe button
all it takes is two seconds that can
help get more marketing monday
content to you it's that easy
maybe hit the bell in the like button
while you're at it if you're feeling
frisky
talk one forever and with this
subscription vacation of everything
which is a word i just coined right
there
yo me um there is a growing theory
that advertising in general is just
becoming a tax on the poor
it's becoming a world where you can
avoid almost
all ads it used to be pervasive and
unavoidable you can start getting them
almost entirely cut out of your life
branded content that's built right in
influencer content
that all that stuff you can't avoid and
that's what that's what that's what
they're training towards
a good point to make here is that um
in general uh to get something to stick
in your brain you gotta see it around
seven
times seven plus times really if you
ever wondered why
you know like um you'll be watching a
football game or a soccer game or
something
and you'll see just like a logo like
like walls of logos around the edge of
the stadium
like what does that really do what
you're not
you're not like oh i saw a logo of this
i'm going to buy it it doesn't even say
anything it's not
it's just a picture of a logo but the
idea is
that every time you see it it's more
likely to stick in your brain
[Music]
for one it's what i think it's an
amazing ad um
super clever uh the subway logo is in it
throughout
you know it's talking about subway it's
so associated with subway in your mind
s tier it's between s and a it's
definitely our highest rated one thus
far i'm gonna put it in s
i think that's easy the five dollar
footlong ad
was so successful that it actually hurt
subway
because they couldn't raise their prices
with inflation
so what they did instead was they they
lowered the length
they made the bread a little shorter
until it wasn't a foot
and then people measured it and sued
[Laughter]
you
[Music]
what i don't like it and why i think
it's it seats here is one it came
after i'm loving it which i'll talk
about later i'm loving it obviously
better more iconic but
notice the difference between i'm loving
it in this
i think the problem with this is that um
it's not as catchy the tune isn't as
good
when you're in my chat saying oh my god
sex sells
this is what i think you look like
hey tear i like it i like where your
head's at boys
it is a catchy jingle and this still
goes
i might have to just ester this bad boy
[Music]
harvey's makes your burger a beautiful
thing
where would you put it boys canadians
are are flipping canadians love this
[ __ ] dude
canadians are saying this was blanketed
i'm sorry ken i'm gonna get all of
canada hey i'm putting c
actually just to avoid the [ __ ] riots
clearly this is touching a personal
[ __ ] note for canadians
and also when i think about it i don't
trust chat i think they didn't like it
because they don't know it
i think that could easily be catchy
swimming hiking
intent pitching they're not fighting
i'm not itching can't wait to show you
all my new tricks thanks again for
sending me canine advantages
did you say sex sells cutie
okay can you just banner she can't come
back to my discord i know she left but
just like let's make it a clean break
i gotta say the one thing that makes
this ad so good is how cute they made
the dog
cute i said i didn't say sexy
furries i said cute he signs it with his
paw
how did he write this it's so impressive
what a smart dog
there ain't no bugs on me there ain't no
bugs on me
there may be bugs on some you mugs but
there ain't no bugs on me
that's almost better because it's
quick that's quick and memorable
i think the first one's a better
commercial and this is a better jingle
but either way we'll average it out to
eights here for k9 advantix
sleep country canada jingle
canadians is your chance to redeem
yourself canada you've already failed
once with your harvey's commercial
we weren't impressed we gave it a seat
here
america now hear the full
might of the canadian marketing military
that's the line you guys haven't figured
out marketing yet canada i'm sorry
i'm sorry you're not there yet
you're you have a you have better health
care you got a better functioning
government
but you haven't figured out marketing
i'm sorry
why buy a mattress anywhere else a lot
of reasons
what if there's a better price a better
product
canada i'm sorry much like most of your
wars you have lost a
[Music]
where does that land for you boys oh my
god are you guys putting that in
s someone said it's better than anything
canada's ever done yeah of course
okay that's a low bar yes that did
defeat all of canada's marketing with
one song
but that that i mean a d tier might do
that i
am going to have to veto i'm sorry boys
your votes are in
and i appreciate you putting in an s
this is not an s to your jingle
all right i'll put it c it's it's no
better than the harvey's one and i just
can't
so bite bite sip sip all right you know
what it's
bottom of b because i actually think it
is better than harvey's
i'm putting as bottom of b i'm putting
as bottom of b
all right well compromise that's it
that's all i can do
[Music]
that's just that is a jingle by
god wait what is this some guy wrote an
original jingle for autozone
to hope they would use it it has 2 000
[Music]
views
hey how you doing today
i see you walk through the doors with a
frown on your face i say
hey please tell me your problem
i'm sure we got the tools you need so we
can solve them
yes indeed we try to serve customers
better
that's why we take the time to price
match our competitors
[Music]
this has no business being this good
i i i can't believe
what what made this guy do this
he doesn't even it's only one brand
he just said one day [ __ ] it i'm going
for it and he made an
autozone jingle and he went absolutely
hard in the paint
that's high that's here baby we found
gold i gotta hire king delroy for nvidia
i would love the story i wonder if i can
get in touch with him and just ask him
that would actually be such a funny
follow-up to marketing monday
if i could interview king delroy and
just hear what was going on
in his life when he created the autozone
jingle
i might have to follow through oh
i leave auto parts
let's do a few more we'll do a few more
and then uh actually
go 11. so we're almost done there's a
wonderful place
in ontario where all the dolls stop
sending me canada so we are farmers
can we just at your est right now atrest
here
oh my god this is the most divisive one
of all
i'm actually liking where this pole's
heading i'm liking it so much i'm gonna
stop the count
stop the count yeah b this is a perfect
b
thank you thank you chad for getting one
right yes this is a b
the tune is not particularly catchy it
doesn't say anything about the brand it
just says liberty over and over and over
um but it's it's still a b i mean it was
an f for so long and then suddenly they
found 100 votes
[Music]
my name is michael levine i'm a composer
and songwriter
they had a campaign they already loved
and they just needed a throwaway song
something for the client to say no to
it's actually true it's always good to
have like a
bad idea everyone wants to
feel like they're contributing
so if you show an executive
an idea and it's perfect
they don't want to just say perfect do
it what they want to do is they want to
feel like they've they've made a
powerful choice like they're they're
they're they have value and so you give
them a bad idea too
and they can say i like that one i like
the good one
we did the vocal in one take and the
instrumental also
in one take but on the bridge of the
song which originally went
you could keep it to yourself but it
wouldn't be fair cause that chocolate
crispy taste is love
everywhere that was he's feeling it
he's feeling it i i you know i would be
proud too if i wrote give me a break
i have a structured settlement but i
need
[Music]
i might low-key put this as one of the
greatest jingles
because not only is it memorable
not only is it catchy and stuck in our
heads
but it has the the brand name jg
wentworth
and because the phone number has cash
now in it
it has a call to action and what they do
in one thing so not only do you know
what they do they get you cash now
but you know how to call them so like
everything you need who they are
what they do and how to contact them is
in their jingle and the jingle's
actually catchy
well i was shopping for a new car which
one's me a cool convertible or an suv
too bad i didn't know my credit was
whack cause now i'm driving off the lot
in a used subcompact
f-r-e-e that spells free
creditreport.com baby
saw their ads on my tv thought about
going but was too lazy now instead of
looking flying rolling fat
my legs are sticking to the vinyl and my
posse's getting laughed at f-r-e-e that
spells freeze
credit report dot com baby so the idea
was i guess
they had the free credit report.com
banned now i have some news for you
we can bridge the gap here they're
canadian
they're all canadian it's a canadian
band
they hired to be the free
creditreport.com band
thus we can bridge the gap i'm gonna put
this
in a solid a tier i think this is the
best thing canada's ever
done i'm gonna have to give it an a
free credit report.com and that's just
on god
no it's not a song you idiot whoever
said it's a song
ban them quack can you find them
stupidest thing i've ever heard my
entire life
the best part of waking up is folders in
your cup
it's not a song it's one of the most top
10 greatest jingles of all time
you also are involved in the mcdonald's
jingle uh
i'm loving it right yes okay and then
the creative agency in germany
responsible for the campaign said pusha
t
had no involvement they said wait what
i've been telling everybody pusha t
wrote that forever
it's [ __ ] ridiculous it's [ __ ]
mcdonald's quoted said that's [ __ ]
ridiculous it's [ __ ]
they sound like me talking to my chat
the german agency delivered the tagline
i'm loving it
and also the five syllable sound
signature of bada
music was supposed to be a huge part of
the campaign
but no one can wrap their heads around
how to make these five
syllables into something musical
so they first called in but stewart wait
they didn't even
they didn't provide the music they
provided just the words
and said make a song out of that from it
that's crazy
songs are writing that down and turning
that in
for a multi-million dollar ad campaign
and that one their plan is to disguise
the slogan in with a catchy pop song
and not to reveal the mcdonald's
connection until much
later after the song has been released
enter justin timberlake
they offered him six million dollars to
record the track
and he does
i can't believe they made a
song become a number one hit as
pre-planning
for a marketing campaign what gets
bumped to make room for i'm loving it
which we all agree is an s tier i mean
the the performances
is undeniable you hate to see it
empire's getting the boot for i'm loving
it
okay this is where we landed i'm gonna
put little caesars up here up here
we didn't get enough seeds i could have
filled it with all of canada's but this
is good

moose a badge and declares him the prime
minister

part of the schedule
sort of popped up the auto zone jingle
welcome
[Music]
[Music]

it to the ceo

love to yeah reach out man actually
i'm trying to get a jingle for the whole
marketing monday show maybe we could
talk i don't know we'll see
see what you charge i'm totally open to
it so let's uh
let's talk more in the future sure but
uh have a good one man
thank you so much bye ladies and
gentlemen that was king delroy that was
awesome please following peter scott
underscore king delray give him a follow
the only problem i have with king delroy
here is that he seems like he's way way
way way way too nice
and i'm so toxic and my community
two things i i picked up from that
conversation is that number one
the autozone ceo responded to him that's
cool
you know maybe they're not going to use
it there's probably some rights issues
actually from using an employee's song
but the ceo responded to him which is
something that's that sick
and then also they got him to do songs
internally which means that's that's
good that's
i respect that a lot mcdonald's blowing
him off
i'm never having until mcdonald's
response to king delroy i will never eat
another burger
and bergsy will now only stand for
non-mcdonald's
burger chains bergsy is taking a stand
dude unless you hire unless you at least
respond to king delroy
let's go into the wins and fails boys
cause i have a i have a big topic today
i need some time to get to it so
okay i'll do the fail first because it's
kind of sad
the fail is people who say we don't need
to do something about student debt
that's the fail okay because i saw this
graph today
this is the percentage of um the
population that's eight that's 15 to 24.
and this is the amount of student debt
right
so in 1980 37 of the country
was 15-24 about college age and there
was no
[ __ ] debt so it's not like it's a
growing population thing
then in 2020 now we have about the exact
same potential people
and the debt in the last since 2010 2020
the student loan debt
has gone to 1.4 trillion it's absolutely
astronomically crazy
and the product they're offering that's
the colleges are offering is exactly the
same in 1980 it hasn't fundamentally
changed
they have not it's not like it's the
iphone versus the a giant ibm pc
the the product is the same yes there
are personal choices you can make
people always talk about oh man you
don't take out this job if you can't get
this
or don't do this alone if you can't
there are certain things you can do but
first of all asking 17 80 girls to make
perfect financial decisions
is stupid that's number one number two
is gating all of the jobs they want to
get behind the need of a degree
and then making that degree cost more
and more every year is is a monopoly
it's a monopoly on a piece of paper that
you need to access
and they can keep charging more and more
for it so this is the fail of the week
this is terrible
um and so i i just i i can't
sympathize with people who don't we it's
fine
so it's not fine the wind though i think
you're gonna like because the wind
though
is this is eminem
eminem came back hard with a diss track
today
aimed squarely at mark zuckerberg okay
someone had to say it and thank god we
got slim shady to do it dude
yo i'm coming for the suck the epic coco
fam when he ain't doing shrooms and
having sex in vip these rigs squaring
his ex employees that he got rid of
claiming he's gonna create another
twitter but let me stop you
[Music]
can i say that you're a computer wait
what does he say
you're a computer weeaboo i'm also a
computer
but i don't suck movies and it's like
damn
the name
the name should be face bark cause
you're all bark you got no bite
that is the win of the week although
it's really a fail on our counts because
i thought the last weapon we had against
ai
was our bars i thought our only defense
against the terminator was gonna be our
bars
our mixtapes our hot fire and now
they're putting eminem out of a job
we talked two weeks ago about how
pokemon's gonna be out of a job actually
he's gonna be out of a job
because of all the digital influencers
now ai's gonna put eminem out of a job
we gotta get king delroy to fight ai
it'll be like a modern-day john henry
it it definitely sounds like that era of
eminem
like really accurately sounds super like
him and it can stay on a beat
and then it wrote the song the song
isn't perfect
but there are bars in here some things
rhyme
you know it it it's pretty impressive
and this is again this is all early days
imagine 20 years from now i don't know
it's all kind of weird it's all kind of
dark and it's all kind of new
but this is my win of the week because
it was way more fire than it had any
right to be

Top 10 Most Overhyped Games of All Time. - YouTube
hey today's topic is over hyped games
specifically the top 10
most over hyped video games of all time
now you may be asking asrock why this
week for this topic
i think we all know why cyberpunk 2077
is on our shores we are little over a
week away
cyberpunk is here and it has the
capability of becoming
the most over hyped game of all time now
i'm excited for it i think it may
live up to expectations but they are
high so in honor of this big release
we're going to go through the top 10
most overhyped games of all time we're
going to rank them
now from a marketing pov let's go into a
little bit before we begin
about why this stuff happens it's gonna
be unique for each game but uh
the general idea in marketing about hype
is this
okay hype is of course a good thing
it's better than being like over hype is
always better than under hype
under hype is is irrelevance
no one buys it overhype means people
will buy it
for a short period of time essentially
hype what it is is lying
what hype is doing is projecting an
image of something that isn't is
illusory it's not real it's not gonna
the product won't match up to what the
consumer technician is
which means they often will buy it
so the uh let's open up the uh photoshop
here
let's get to the top 10 most over hyped
games
of all time starting with number 10.
number 10. peggy 18.
watch dogs now the reason it's number 10
and not higher
is because the game itself is not bad
watchdog is not a terrible game but
watchdogs is
absolutely an over hyped game
if you watch what they were talking
about
at e3 2012 we're gonna watch the e3
video it's
absolutely astronomically different from
the final product
they lied they openly lied dude they
cranked up the graphics they ran it on
high-end pcs instead of the consoles
that we normally on
they added things scripted that were
never going to be in the game
they just openly misrepresented what the
game was going to be like
like it's the gameplay the gameplays
where it's crazy all right look
they made this seem like gameplay like
this is all seamless the game doesn't
feel like this but when you watch it
they added this mini map they made it
seem like this is
gameplay footage and it's 2012 by the
way so the graphics are really good
like they're making the graphics look
really good they don't look like this so
okay we're adding this to the list watch
dogs
coming in at number nine is
mighty number nine oh number nine is
mighty number nine
this game was a kickstarter game that
promised
to bring back the magic
of mega man to rekindle
what mega man fans had lost
their opinions are it was dog [ __ ] he
raised 900 000
in the first day of this kickstarter it
touched the nerve in the gaming
community
people wanted this bad people were
treating it was like it was going to be
the second coming for classic action
games dude
over i mean look the concept bar was so
cool
man it had everything people wanted i
mean but then there was delay
after delay after delay which by the way
is giving me some
some cyberpunk vibes delay out their
delay after delay
and then um at one point
the hype for the game was so much that
legendary pictures the the people that
made
uh batman begins and a bunch of other
great movies
uh optioned uh the rights for a film
they optioned the rights for the film to
make my number nine into a movie because
they were so sure it was gonna be a
great big media franchise uh anyway it
came out
it wasn't really anything like the
concept art uh
it didn't look anything like the
original kickstarter campaign it was
critically panned
it was boring it was pretty bad it
looked like an amateur game
the end of the day it was like it was
like a very much like a kid's first game
like like a guy you'd make it in uh
school
it was just a week week game it did not
seem polished like a million dollars if
it's been on it
put it on the 3ds box didn't even come
out
[Laughter]
did it never come out on 3ds that's
[ __ ] funny
i gotta have connor join me for one of
these he's got he's got good insights
okay number eight number eight number
eight number eight number eight now this
is gonna be
this one's gonna shock you guys this
might even be wrong
it's no man's sky okay and look
only number eight is is pretty low
for how badly this game burned people
this is all a lie by the way none of
this was there at launch yeah i mean
look
they just promised the absolute world
this is a spreadsheet
of all the things they probably this
this game might be number one but let me
give you my reasoning
let me give you my reasoning i did not
put no man sky
super high on this list for two reasons
but the most important is this column
they added all of these things all these
things they talked about
large-scale space battles destroying
space stations roaming freighters crash
faders npc ships
radio chatter rivers uh water worlds
all this stuff they all talked about it
and none of it was there at launch
this game was one of the most
disappointing launch games in history
and if i
only talked about the moment of launch
it's just got to be like number one i
mean really it's
it if you consider overhyping to be
lying
that's what they did but in the interim
sense if you've ever watched there's a
great video called the in goodening of
no man's sky
it's really long so we can't watch it
today but you should watch it um
the developers just got caught in a sort
of
terrible web of lies and
their response to getting caught in it
and being universally hated
was to dig deep shut up and work on
their game
and so for that i can't
i think it would be boring for this list
to put him at the top that's why that's
why i didn't do it
all right number seven you are probably
shocked that no man's sky was that low
but you probably won't be shocked that
this one is on the list
and that of course is fallout
76 yeah basically the one contribution
this game made
to gaming culture was making uh country
roads popular again
yeah 16 yeah they did they said a bunch
of things i wonder if it's in this
they said 16 times the detail they said
like a bunch of weird um
like the game world is so epically big
and there's so much to do and there's so
much detail they paused
so many so many things for fallout fans
they used all their fallout fan credit
[Music]
oh this is actual gameplay footage from
when it came out
dude this game on release was probably
the buggiest game
maybe the buggiest aaa game i could
think of in the past 10 years i mean
it was so bad
fallout 76 number seven okay number six
on the list of most over hyped games of
all time
anthem anthem is number six on our most
overhyped game of all time
and this one's a doozy this one could
even be higher i mean this one
this one was so over hyped had such a
massive massive marketing spend it was
hyped as the destiny
killer they saw destiny's budding
success
as you know destiny launched with kind
of mixed reviews and then sort of built
itself into a really popular game
popular franchise and destiny 2 got even
bigger and
and uh anthem was supposed to join that
that area and be just a huge success
we're now in the top five the top five
most over hyped games
of all time what is remaining what can
we find out
who is left let's start
with number five of course this one's a
doozy okay
it's kind of tough to uh it's kind of
tough to explain
uh so i'm gonna i'm gonna get one
example
neo found a way so
the first part of this is the matrix
online
this game came out 2005 uh the height
of matrix mania the matrix sequels
had done huge numbers well no the second
one done huge numbers the box i was
three was a flop
um the people were loving the matrix and
then the matrix
you know every gamer kid was wanted to
be neo
the games were huge i mean the the the
the story in the universe was huge
they got uh official voice acting from
the characters for this
and it was supposed to be a godlike mmo
wow
killer type beat and it was a
buggy empty mess but
this is not only this is not only the
matrix online
maybe you heard of this 70 years ago
heroes first appeared in paragon city
city of heroes
the point i'm making folks i could go on
i actually have about six more trailers
here but i think we get the idea
the point of this i'm making
every single mmo
that has called itself a wow killer
in any way has been
a flop over hyped flop
every single one has failed
wow launched in 2004
and has a ton of players and a ton of
money
so they have a ton of developers working
around the clock
every year to add new content
it has 20 years of content
so whenever you launch a new mmo it
always feels so
empty it always feels like it doesn't
have enough
because you have your scrappy team
trying to build this gigantic world mm's
are huge
and you don't have enough and so
okay let's get the number four we're not
top four here
number four on the most overhyped games
of all time star wars battlefront is a
perfect number four
so we'll put star wars battlefront
number four let's watch the star wars
battlefront um
this game i can't think of
one game where the graphics have been
this good and the game this
disappointing
and it's beautiful and it's clearly made
by star wars fans
and it has so much detail and everyone's
so excited like oh my god it's going to
be a true turn to form
the game i love but of course
of course ea finds a way
not just bad games but like over like
it's these are
it's funny it's like the perfect storm
is a publisher with a huge marketing
budget
and a mediocre to bad game number three
number three
anyway this is my number one but it's
number three on my list
okay
this is fable one and this game
is still great
fable is a good game that is why
when i tell you that it's one of the
most overhyped games of all time
if you're not a boomer you probably
don't even remember you have to believe
me
but in this game came out in 2004 this
is before twitch this is before a lot of
ways you can find out the truth about
games
this is early days of games media we
still had magazines for christ's sake
and you could pay off those magazines
and say anything you could lie to them
and peter molyneux who is the game
director of fable
promised the [ __ ] world
but this person said it it's frustrating
because it was a fun game in spite of
peter molyneux promising and lying about
it so hard
it would be less disappointing a game if
it was outright said to be linear as
[ __ ]
and the morality system was largely
meaningless okay
let's get to number two
this game is actually good
uh okay i'm seeing a lot of revisionist
history from the zoomers
who all played this collectively on your
mom's ipad
okay any game you play while drinking
from a sippy cup
on your mom's ipad is not good
this game is not good and it certainly
is not
living up to what they promised it's an
it's a decent game
if it was like a tech demo it's fun i
played sport
this game is nowhere near what they
promised
they promised much like no man's sky a
life
simulator so someone made our little
champs irresistible to the opposite sex
[Music]
there we go that's why zoomers like it
huh amazing
there we go i figured it out no i was
wondering i was like why did you guys
like this game
what's the it was your first experience
with any sex
that's what it was i got it
this game sucked i'll say it i was so
disappointed with this game
this game this game really disappointed
me okay that was number two boys let me
add to the chart
now number one it's time
for number one of the top 10
most over hyped games of
all time
what is the most overhapped game of all
time
who could it be you guys you guys are
not guessing
well this is the answer i'll explain why
damn the pixels to be shown
[Music]
it's dai katana dai katana now let me
give you the back story because zoomers
are knocking what the [ __ ] this is
all right so if you guys know
the first major big smash blockbuster
super game
is quake okay
quake is a massive success and it makes
john romero
the first famous game developer he
called it john romero's daikatana
yeah he did he did wolfenstein doom
and quake and his software he became
mega famous
sold multiple millions okay and he
started promising
that this game was going to be the
greatest game of all time
now let me show you it has one of the
most famous gaming ads of all time it's
why i included it
this ad is why i include it and if you
weren't around for this ad
you wouldn't know you wouldn't know why
this is number one right they took out
all these full page ads in every game
magazine
that said john romero's about to make
you his [ __ ]
suck it down
and let me tell you something doing this
now would get headlines
but doing this back in 99 was
absolutely crazy i i cannot overstate to
you
how big of a drama and a hype this
caused
not only was it an incredibly incredibly
generic shooter
with terrible ai
by the way someone said he kind of did
though he did kind of make everyone who
bought it his [ __ ]
[Laughter]
which is kind of funny kind of true but
it's just
it's not always it's super duper generic
but it's also
at this point by the time it releases
incredibly outdated
like shooters have been always at the
forefront of pioneering new game stuff
because of the biggest selling so by the
time what year did this come out
it was like a kind of cooler quake clone
if it had released when it was first
announced so
as boomer as it is if you look at the
whole history of games and you're honest
i gotta say this is a great contender
for number one most important game of
the time
especially because it's one of the very
first it's the first time we fell for
the
great developer promises the moon gamut
it's happened a million times ever
but this is the first time we had a
famous developer tell us he was gonna
just [ __ ]
give us everything we wanted and it
really
really really
[Music]
little flopped
What was the smartest Corporate Buyout of All Time? - YouTube
marketing monday today's topic the best
acquisitions
of all time let me give an example
amazon bought twitch for a billion
dollars
okay now that was in 2014.
six years later has that been worth it
how much is twitch worth to amazon now
that's the idea okay number one this is
acquisitions not mergers
so for example um exxon and mobile
merged to make exxonmobil that dominated
the oil market
for years and years and years and made a
[ __ ] absolute gargantuan ton of money
i don't include that number 10 of the
best acquisitions of all time
i am of course speaking of this one's
gonna surprise you
can anyone guess boner no
fortnite no bungie
number 10 is bungie acquired by
microsoft
for a mere 30 million dollars
prior to the launch of the xbox 30
million dollars
is nothing in business that would mean
nothing if the company didn't generate
much return
but even if you only count the profits
on the revenue
from halo games and and merchandise and
stuff alone
that's five billion dollars and to put
that into scale
i created this chart this is master
chief
sized at 30 million dollars okay look
how cute he is
this is master chief sized
at five billion dollars
i had to cut off this part because it
lags my computer
this is to scale you're probably
thinking that's enough on its own to be
in the top ten
but i actually don't think it would but
i'm including and the reason i included
this
is because my honest opinion and theory
is that from a marketing pov
the xbox would have died if it weren't
for halo
we would not had an xbox 360 because the
only thing that made this a viable
competitor to sony
and nintendo out of the gate was that
they had an absolute
killer app in halo so that's why it's my
number ten i think bungie was a
fantastic acquisition
number nine number nine greatest
acquisition of all time
disney buys pixar
do you remember the movie brother bear
you might not
whether or not you know these films
they [ __ ] sorry
they sucked they did not do well
now disney animation in the 90s was on a
massive tear they did aladdin they did
lion king
did mulan they did hercules they did
uh pocahontas they did all these really
big
big big hits okay movies that did
hundreds of millions in worldwide box
office that captured the imagination of
kids everywhere
that were selling a ton of merch these
movies
had cult followings but they didn't do
the same
and bob iger looks around in 2000 or
2004 in that era
and i remember in the book he says he
was looking out at a disney parade
and he noticed there wasn't a single
character in the float
that had been made in the past like 10
years
it was all like simba from the lion king
and aladdin
and the little mermaid and it was like
all of the iconic characters that
everybody loved
were from old stuff and all their new
[ __ ] like all this
wasn't really hitting disney animation
was fading and it was hurting the whole
company disney was really like
sliding into a possible irrelevancy and
he was worried because the things that
were doing good in this time
uh oh toy story bug's life
finding nemo those movies did have huge
franchises
those movies were amazing that was what
pixar was doing
bob eiger posted steve jobs disney
buying pixar
and at first he says no hell no of
course not
there's no way it would make sense but
they they warm up to it they start going
through ideas
and then seven billion reasons later
which is the purchase price they got
pixar making steve jobs
absolutely insanely wealthy because he
bought the original starting a pixar for
absolutely nothing
it's always crazy to me that like in his
off time
steve jobs founded pixar lucasfilm
george lucas's company
had a uh computer animation division
they spun off and they sold
and steve jobs bought it and turned it
into pixar while he was fired from apple
and he in that time founded pixar and
ended up being massively successful and
it was like a side gig for him and he
was ceo of pixar crazy
pixar movies now make about a billion
dollars a year
but the rough estimate is that
for every billion dollars you make at a
box office at disney
you're making two times that on merchant
theme parks
there's there's more money in the toys
so they make about
three billion dollars per movie that's
this is a conservative estimate
because really without it disney
wouldn't turn around at all disney was
in a slide and this this turned
everything around
not only did they hire pixar to like um
make great movies but they hired the
talent from pixar
to run disney animation there's pretty
much no doubt in my mind that frozen
would not have been created if they
hadn't bought pixar pixar changed the
whole culture of disney
and ended up pleasing to the massive
success that is frozen
super successful great job by bob iger
smart of him to see that value
but here's the deal here's the deal boys
it wasn't his best acquisition
because number eight here on my list
is actually more valuable than pixar was
if you can believe it a marvel movie may
also makes as much as a pixar movie
about a billion dollars per year
but here's the thing about marvel the
difference is
marvel puts out more than one movie a
year pixar at best is doing about one a
year
marvel's cranking out two three
sometimes four and marvel at this point
has already generated more money for
disney
than pixar and it was acquired later and
for less
so you know pixar cost seven something
billion uh marvel cost about half that
about four
but what's crazy about marvel is how
smart it was
i think pixar was a very easy one to see
i think you could see okay picture is
doing great in animation we're doing
terribly
marvel at the time it was acquired had
one movie
in marvel studios iron man and most of
their ip
a lot of their most famous heroes were
already licensed out
they were in long-term 10-year contracts
with like sony and other companies
so even if you buy marvel half the
heroes you don't even own yet you can't
use them
they thought super long term they built
this whole expanded universe
and it led to an insane insane insane
amount of money and
insane amount of merch and insane amount
of like relevancy and
a worldwide box office gross of 2.797
billion
that is three-fourths of the purchase
price of marvel itself
they bought marvel for 4 billion and
then end game alone
made 3 billion back number seven is
i think the best media acquisition of
all time
some of you guys are not gonna know what
this is
but i'll try to explain it in terms you
can understand sports aka
pick up a football and watch espn
espn this one is the oldest one i think
on my list it was done in 1984
espn uh was purchased for a paltry
188 million dollars in 1984
and is now worth roughly 31.2 billion
espn i mean i can't even scale that one
i could do the halo example but again
this was 30 million to 5 billion
i to go to 30 billion would crash my
computer
espn is worth so much more when they
were acquired
and it's because they became essentially
the de facto
uh way that people interact with sports
for for decades now
the amount of money you sort of think
about yeah again i i wanted to include
more scale examples because it's hard to
think like
30 billion how much of that is so much
money 30 billion dollars is so much
money and to make 10 billion dollars in
revenue a year
is crazy so
that yeah they bought football espn's
starting to slide
because everyone's cutting cord on cable
and they're starting to interact with
sports in new ways
the internet is really disrupting espn
they should just buy the internet
that's a great idea
what if they just bought the whole
internet
holy [ __ ] paypal
paypal poggies although we're all cash
app stands now huh
what happened here elon huh
this is elon musk at paypal when it was
acquired
this is somehow him [ __ ] 20 years
later
where'd the hair come from elon the
number six acquisition is elon musk
acquiring these hair plugs and a good
night's sleep
that has made him the second richest man
of all time because he's way easier to
look at
um paypal was acquired by
ebay this is the power of ebay
it's a tough fit
let's just see if we can
put this on i'm gonna rip it
i'm gonna rip it uh so i guess i did not
realize it was a youth medium and not
a regular medium i will have to slim
down a bit
i'll have to stop eating so many
mcdoubles and uh
it was bought for 1.5 billion
it's worth about 50 billion right now
that's revenue i'm sorry 50 billion is
revenue paypal is currently worth 250
billion
i'm sorry do you guys get the scope now
the student has become the master google
buying android everything cratered and
now the world is literally divided
between
android and ios so if you want to put
anything out on mobile
you have to use google play or you have
to use ios there is no other option is
it duopoly
hey i cucks look at the graph listen
i hope there's people that are not in a
deep
online war over what mobile ios you lose
you use
at the time uh they got acquired by
google for 50 million dollars which is
just nothing it's just nothing
now they are worth an estimated and part
of their contribution to google
72 billion alone probably more but let's
just let's let's conserve an estimate 72
billion
and that's why zuck like fears google
zuckerberg is trying to own vr because
he thinks vr is the only thing that can
break away from
how much google owns phones this is
another one
from our boys at google they just keep
on hitting
uh and this one you're probably not
going to recognize but i actually had to
include it i didn't want to include it
originally
and that is google's acquisition of
doubleclick now let me explain what
doubleclick is in case you're like
who megalo who megawall excuse me
uh what about fortnite you're saying
that's gotta be bigger than doubleclick
this is the google pie okay
this part is youtube
this part is what's called google
network
and then this part in yellow
is search advertising okay
which is what doubleclick allowed them
to do which became
incredibly lucrative and also let them
run ads on other people's sites
it became like this foundational network
that every site plugs into and now
people can buy ads for any site
it's pacman they acquired pacman
and for acquiring doubleclick for a mere
3.1 billion it is now
worth roughly 126.4 billion
uh when i read about it one thing that
was interesting was that they said um
it's very unlikely that if this deal
were to come by today
that the government would even let it
through because it gave google such a
monopoly
over online advertising yes sir
three in a row google acquisitions are
three of the greatest of all time
this is of course where you guys watch
your jake paul
youtube baby by the way if you're not
subbed to a truck on youtube
watch take a moment and hit that
subscribe button it costs you nothing
60 of my viewers are not subscribed
we're on paced hit 50 000 subscribers in
my first
five months of uploading youtube i'm
extremely excited i've had a lot of fun
with youtube
and it would be [ __ ] awesome to me if
i could hit 50k
by december by the end of the year uh so
if you get a chance it costs you nothing
but make me really happy
hit subscribe youtube is just
dollar for dollar of [ __ ] crazy
crazy crazy bears acquisition
i mean youtube is the internet for a lot
of people
this is it this is video on the internet
yahoo exec rips google
for overpaying for youtube
[Laughter]
yeah man yeah man that aged well
you [ __ ] idiot yeah nimrod
within a few years from this yahoo would
be defunct completely
and then google would have youtube which
is like
so insanely profitable worth about 86.2
billion dollars right now
the estimate i've heard is that youtube
was its own company it would be worth
over 150 billion dollars
you're telling me you wouldn't pay 150
billion dollars
for the rights to baby shark gangnam
style
despacito yeah of course
so that's why this is easily the number
three greatest acquisition of all time
a lot of these acquisitions especially
the biggest ones are companies that are
[ __ ]
huge and strong realizing that
something's about to disrupt them
so google was like oh [ __ ] the future of
the internet is not
search it's video and if we don't invest
and own youtube and build that out we
could get
made irrelevant now number two is of
course the louisiana purchase
how could i not include it now i just
didn't want to put it so early you guys
are all right every time you guessed it
for all 10
it's definitely not where all my
versions of chat feel bad about their
lives
instagram instagram
was purchased forget this
a single one billion dollars
one billion to between 200 and 300
billion dollars
probably greater because instagram is
essentially the most dominant and
influential social platform currently
if you want to advertise online you have
two options you go to google
or you go to facebook you advertise on
search and web or you advertise on
social twitch was also bought
for one billion dollars around the same
time
two companies made acquisitions okay
facebook bought instagram for a billion
and amazon but twitch for a billion now
six years later in 2020
instagram is worth hundreds of billions
of dollars it is the biggest social
platform in the world
it has a massive growth and it makes a
ton of money twitch
still loses money and is being sued
by a million record labels
the greatest acquisition of all time
what is number one
is it minecraft poggies is it
fortnite is it nvidia acquiring
atriac from twitch
for a six figure salary yes it is
[Music]
number one the greatest acquisition of
all time
is when apple acquired
this guy and his company his company
called
next apple's acquisition of next
now let me tell you the story because i
don't think zoomers know the story
people think
uh steve jobs just founded apple and
stayed with apple
no here's what happened steve jobs
found apple and then he uh doesn't know
what he's
doing because he's a kid it starts doing
pretty well it goes public and it's
worth a billion dollars
and he realizes he's not cut out
currently at his age he's not cut out to
be
ceo so he goes to pepsi and he tells the
ceo of pepsi
do you want to sell sugar water or do
you want to change the world
and so he gets the ceo of pepsi to come
over to apple
john scully and then that guy and steve
do not end up getting along
and they forced steve out of apple in
the late 80s
he's forced out of the company and he
ends up uh
buying what would become pixar which is
like the genius thing to do in your off
time
and he starts a company called next a
company that was going to compete with
apple
and make computers the problem was
like most things steve jobs does this
[ __ ] was
way too expensive the next computers
were way
way way way too expensive and nobody
wanted to buy them
okay but they had
really really good operating systems
when you're acquiring a company usually
you're acquiring them for the product
but sometimes
if they have talent you really want the
people you really want like really
talented engineers
or product people it's called an aqua
hire where basically you're hiring
you're buying the company just to get
the people
and so what they did was apple spent
400 million dollars 429 million dollars
they got steve jobs
back in the company he made him interim
ceo it's funny i found some old articles
from the time where they're like
steve jobs is going to be the interim
ceo but we're definitely getting a
different ceo
so don't worry he's just gonna hold down
the fort for a little bit and then he
held it out until he died
once he was in once he was back in he
never let go
97 right around here they acquired next
and get him back
and around here he becomes ceo so right
around here
he dies but all of this comes from the
iphone
and a lot of the eye products and stuff
that he started alright because the
scale of this number is so high
you can't really see the changes here
but apple's revenue was going down
so it was a company that was on the
verge of death it was doing terribly
so when he joined it truly did turn
around a company that was feeling
they spent 400 400 million dollars to
become a two trillion dollar company
in conclusion the number one acquisition
of all time
apple acquires next getting steve jobs
and a better ios
and that my friends i believe
well argued well accurate are the 10
greatest acquisitions of all time
[Music]
so honorable mission i did not include
mixer acquiring ninja
that one was a real hit
When Marketing Goes Wrong.... - YouTube
so today's get smarter saturdays we're

lot of options let's someone had a good

this video is sponsored by raid shadow
legends
there's your first mistake in the early
2010s brands were only just finding
their foothold in social media
they didn't quite understand how to
connect with their audience
fries for your wait i want to see what
wendy's used to do on social media fries
for your frenemy fries for your bank
teller fries for
that guy hashtag fry for all
this is a [ __ ] stance tweet through
and through
i'm pretty sure stan just tweeted this
word for word
the tendency was to be a bit overly
formal stuffy
i'm sorry is there anything more
fly than drinking pepsi max while
listening to the sweet sounds of snoop
dogg
[ __ ] true i'm gonna retweet it

tweet
[Laughter]
i forgot about this suicidal sunny d

situations

little
content renaissance chick-fil-a that's
not bad
wait that's not bad don't have a
bookmark try using oreo
that's a funny that's funny it's right
in the middle ground it's funny it
stands out
it is this is pretty clever it's just
like a medium joke it's like it's like a
better than average commercial this is
not bad at all
this whoever made this found a way to
get
a good amount of engagement features
oreo in it
it's kind of cheeky and funny this is
fine
and the barnes noble replies funny
imagine if we opened on sundays
had to give everyone else like wendy's a
chance to make money
your mom is a ho
[Laughter]
okay see that's funnier obviously that's
funnier but that's not one you can get
past the board
wait what the [ __ ] is this is this
stakehomes
stakehom says why are so many young
people flocking to brands on social
media for love guidance and attention
i'll tell you why they're isolated from
real communities working service jobs
they hate
while barely making ends meet meat
spelled likes
meat like steak [ __ ] terrible time to
and are living with unchecked personal
slash mental health
problems and they struggle to not just
be happy
but survive this chaotic time with every
problem happening at once under a
microscope
now they're being resold their
childhoods by remakes sequels spin-offs
and other cheap nostalgia
making them more cynical to growth or
authenticity
they have full access to social media
and the information
highway but they feel more alone and
insecure than ever
being behind a screen 24 7 has made them
numb to everything
anxious and depressed about everything
and vitriolic or closed off towards
anyone different from them
young people today have it the best and
the worst
they go to obscure absurdist humor they
go to frozen meat companies on twitter
end rant stay come bless holy [ __ ]
god damn based it actually is
it's the most ironically true source
it's true that the this could only have
come from a food brand on twitter
but with all these relatable calm down
it's a virgin like you
all right you know what we all have it
hard enough
without the marketing trend of the day
being insulted by every company we buy
from
you know is gucci just gonna call me a
little [ __ ] is that the next
wave this is crazy dude if gucci tweeted
their latest product a new belt or
something and just said you're too poor
keep scrolling
holy [ __ ] they'd get retweets guys
we get it you're relatable i just
it just stop relating stop stop enough
that's it sorry what the [ __ ] was that
annoying
what the [ __ ] is this
is that real no
no no no no no no no no
no no no no veggie tales did not
never
[Laughter]
that's real
obviously no it's not real like it's
still up
obviously deleted that is so
insane they made this [ __ ] image
of this [ __ ] smiling pickle
i'm sorry i'm sorry oh i'm sorry i don't
know he's a [ __ ]
cucumber i'm sorry i know about
larry the cucumber you [ __ ]
never forget hey you know what never
forget
all they tried to do is send a nice
message with some cute characters is
that really such a crime
is that i don't know why they had to be
smiling that was my one
my one concern was why they had to be
smiling but
[ __ ] that save that nasty [ __ ] for
someone else
i would rather drink your social media
person's piss than coconut water
address
oh [ __ ] it's
it's obviously a good roast but the end
of the day
you don't ever want the word piss and
your brand to even be associated
and this is such a powerful mental image
when you think of vito coco
you're gonna remember the [ __ ] piss
jar
and it's gonna make it less appetizing
no matter what take it anymore
all right silence brand
and so a new meme was born the spider
crab with laser eyes aerial font 32
points
black bar background no shadow the
[ __ ] bane of marketers everywhere
it's the counter weapon to marketers
worldwide
and it was a very powerful tool eminem's
pushing something rather
take that brand hey fellow gen zeus
silence brad and it became a long
and enduring meme mcdonald's
is a business it's a pleasure
in january of 2012 they had a brilliant
idea
let us improve brand perception with
twitter
this is why twitter can't make any money
dude this is explaining to me why
[ __ ] twitter is having such a hard
time reaching brands
[Laughter]
because all the big brands already tried
and got [ __ ] roasted
mcd stories and here's where things took
a turn
they wanted the twitter public to tell
their experiences at mcdonald's
obviously only good things ever happen
at mcdonald's
this is going to be a slam dunk within
five minutes it was clear that people
weren't going to harp on about the time
they got a free extra sauce with their
mcnuggets
instead they were going to tell mchorror
stories
here's just a select few story wait i
saw one that was like
a worker in my hometown had to pee but
they wouldn't let him because he was on
the grill in a rush
peed down his leg really that's
[ __ ] disgusting he's making the food
pissing himself
a woman makes soliciting mc6 in the
drive-thru lane
i'll look this one up by the way it's
true
in exchange for mcnuggets more and more
people were publishing their negative
stories on the hashtag
within two hours they pulled down the
advertising campaign and
instead put up a far more innocuous
little things hashtag the media jumped
on the story
case studies were written and lessons
were learned about
not giving the public this is why every
brand is afraid of twitter
this makes sense when they still
advertise on facebook it's safer
brands are afraid they don't want to get
roasted they don't want an open public
they can't moderate

What's the best Holiday Commercial Ever? - YouTube
i said this wait oh
oh no please ignore that
ignore that ignore that
[ __ ] god damn it i can't get the [ __ ]
the thing right one week every week i
mess up the lower third
every week the lower thresh either not
there or it's too early
i can't do it it's time to jump into the
actual content of marketing monday which
none of you were spoiled on
let's do it the best holiday ads
ever and it's snowing it's snowing here
in my room let's talk about
the three things to make a good holiday
ad if you are
samsung why do you pay
ryan reynolds to be in your ad
why hot canadian sex sells he has the
voice of
a god you're getting the general gist of
it the general idea
is he has a lot of positive associations
so basically you're using ryan reynolds
and you're just rubbing him on your
product and hoping some of that shine
will stick to your product so with
holiday the number one thing you want to
see in a good
holiday ad are like holiday tropes
because an ad lets you use positive
things
for free you don't have to pay ryan
reynolds millions of dollars
you can use christmas trees number two a
good holiday ad
will be on the on the the feels
side of the emotional spectrum generally
if a good holiday ad is going to take
advantage of the fact that
during the holidays we're all in our
fields a little bit more
we're all a little more likely to think
um
about family and love and
where things are going and connection
and
friendship and we're thinking of all
those things and and if you try to go
with a
a summer type ad that's very shock value
generally you're going to find yourself
rejected all right it's not it's not
it's not the right play now number three
the last thing and this applies to all
ads you have to feature
the product this is true of all ads
every out of you have to say it but it's
so important
marketers get lost in the idea they're
like okay oh
okay let's tell a deep story oh we
forgot to include anything that reminds
you of a product
so they just take 45 seconds of your
time they make you cry
and you have no idea what you're buying
if you just do one and two you're just a
a a guy who wanted to be a director and
couldn't get the chance let's start with
a pepsi commercial because i always hate
pepsi commercials
santa my man making a pepsi but mr claus
i thought you had to deal with uh you
know
i'm on vacation i wanna have a
[Music]
[Applause]
where do you fall one to five five is
best one is worst that is one of my
favorite pepsi ads i've ever seen
easily we'll go to 350 yeah we're here
we're gonna you guys put it out of four
i'm in that range i like it this is not
a holiday ad
i'm pretty sure this this came out in
the summer right this is the summertime
ad
it's a knock at coco's dominance of the
holidays
they openly show their competitors
product which is usually a huge
no-no but i think it actually makes the
ad because you get the joke so quickly
pepsi's long-time ad tradition has been
like okay we have boring
weird ads and we're gonna throw
celebrities on them this is not that
there's no celebrities in this
and the fact they say you know in the
summertime when things are fun
santa prefers pepsi i think this is
really clever i think giving it a four
is deserved
instead of paying uh kim kardashian
uh gazillion dollars you can hire an
actor just by santa and get the same
amount of brand recognition
for free i'm sorry not actor no the real
i'm sorry i'm sorry
zoomers uh no they got the real santa he
just did it for other goodness of his
heart
they got the real santa to come down and
star in the ad he's not no he's not fake
i'm sorry i was
i misspoke no he's obviously look at him
he's real of course
and he really does love that pepsi yum
yum yum bye bye bye
actually i was just speaking to him and
he said um a great gift for christmas
for yourself is six months ahead of of
tier one
disneyland snowman commercial let's
check this
walk down out street
okay snowman a symbol
come live your dream this holiday season
during the year of a million dreams at
the place where dreams come true
visit disneyparks.com what do you think
i'm trying to be
uh objective here and talk about the ad
the content of the ad
and not the fact that it was literally
like next pixel
it felt like an ad for [ __ ] tetris uh
you guys put it out of two
yeah uh yeah let's let's lock that in it
certainly didn't stand out
it's exactly what you'd expect very
boilerplate
very meh this scene i i think they could
have gone harder with this scene
if i'm looking at it i think this is
like the crux of the whole piece
and i think making this a little sadder
amp it up
the tears a little bit you know the kids
parents should die
oh he made the ad i thought you just
didn't like the actor
oh you mean in the ad you think in the
30-second ad they should kill the kid's
parents
it should be like the snowman doing this
the snowman doing this
a cutaway to a funeral with the kid at
his parents funeral
another thing you could have done is
have
mickey put the hat on his head mickey's
jewish
that wouldn't stop him it's a holiday ad
he's not like vicki's like
i can't i can't be in this ad i'm jewish
let's watch this nintendo dsi holiday
commercial
and see what we
good don't you think we deserve
something awesome if you invite us
we'll play mario games because they're
the best
look at my recommended
i've been watching so many [ __ ]
things on get smarter saturday
this is my recommended
we landed on a solid one
and you know what free melee
[ __ ] this adds a one nintendo
um a free melee
your ad stinks but but on the real it's
not at once it's about a three
it's targeting parents now they had to
pay to put this in the right spots this
is for parents of kids this age
it's it's clever it shows the product
[ __ ] front and center and makes it
part of the show
this is a good ad on a lot of levels uh
it's
at least a three but nintendo sucks they
screwed melee over so it's a one
and we stand by that you think the kids
parents should die
i'm noticing a trend i'm noticing a
trend
let me guess the next ad there'll be
something
in it and you guys will spam
that person should die we can't not we
can't not watch so
okay so i got you something dude you did
not
get me the msi geforce rtx 2070 super
gaming card
that's so crazy it's so cringe
who talks like that you know i was there
for the filming of this i was i was off
camera i'm
i'm there that's cool but i play
minecraft i don't need
new graphics just wasn't true at the
time
is true now is true
now slime crushes this role by the way
you got snubbed for the oscar this year
obviously they got snubbed he played an
amazing role as
background party actor three it was
chef's kiss
trust me look at that look at the way he
drinks it
i mean he disappears he disappears into
the role
rtx
i need i need that as an alert i
need i need that sound bite as a sub
alert
[Laughter]
i'm sorry i don't know this guy he's one
of their friends
his ad-libs really
really make them his
ad-libs really make the ad
mine how short is the other guy now this
guy's four
one and ludwig obviously is a commanding
for six so he's
he towers over him i don't know if this
poll is truly
accurate but you guys have given it a
five
as in a perfect ad i do not think this
made people
buy rtx 2070s i don't think it was a
very
convincing ad of the benefits i would
probably give it a
maybe a two maybe if lud died
i think i'd probably give it a two and
maybe a three because of slime's
performance
this is perfect for my chat because they
all
drive mercedes benzes a mercedes-benz ad
to be a fobner success wasn't just
expected
it was demanded things started off great
we had our grand opening customer
relations
whatever was necessary to be a
successful salesman at mercedes of north
pole you have to wear a lot of hats
because if you don't layer you'll die
foot traffic was
disappointing by fall things were
looking desperate
daddy's home did you sell a car today
dad
[Laughter]
a miracle so this customer walks in
red suit jolly smelled like cookies
he knew every model every color that he
wanted
overnight mercedes-benz north pole
became the top-selling dealership in the
world
management was thrilled happy holidays
from mercedes-benz
it's it's rare that a two-minute ad
didn't feel boring they show a car
breaking which is so rare
let me just tell you a car ad showing
one of their cars getting damaged
is so outlandish i'm
i don't know it just shows a little bit
of bravery are you guys landing on a
five
i think four or five i mean look if it's
not a five it's
only because it's um long it's a clever
idea it's a really clever idea
opening dealership in the north pole is
and then they have his wife
not be you know she's not even
supportive which is funny
there's a lot of small choices that
could have been like they could have
gone safer and they didn't
and that's why i'm impressed it's a good
ad but it doesn't sell me a car
don't don't be so specific on that
you're not in the market for a
mercedes-benz or if you're a type person
who's rich enough
to buy their husband or wife a gift card
for christmas
they just put that on your radar are you
in mercedes-benz market
i drive a honda fit dude
i didn't want to get one but then my
girlfriend and i were like
we're gonna drive our bikes so often
we're gonna ride our bikes so often in
san jose when we move down here for
nvidia we're gonna be biking around so
often we're gonna need a car that can
fit the bikes in the back
i did that one time literally
one time if i actually put the bike in
the back of the car
that was the entire reason we bought it
oh this one
this is actually on my list
[Applause]
very simple ver we don't even really
need to review it's just
one of the longest running holiday ads
ever it gets the point across so
succinctly and they combo this with the
special wrapping of the
the packaging usually candy spikes
around halloween
hershey's kisses spike around holidays
yeah this is part of my list i was going
to put it
as a four or five it's great great great
ad
not only do the kisses not correspond to
any given note
the rhythm and the amount of kisses
being rung in quotes
at any given moment is seemingly
arbitrary the final nail in the coffin
is the lack of any form of yellow tree
topper to complete the picture
two out of ten and that's generous
there's some harsher critics in my chat
folger's ad
brother and sister home for christmas
2009
i must have the wrong house sister
[Music]
oh i missed you i brought you something
from far away
[Music]
really oh
[Music]
what are you doing you're my present
this year
[Laughter]
[Music]
okay why wouldn't they just make it his
wife
character i must have the wrong house
sister
[Music]
why why why even include that the whole
sister this is the one time where i
don't think chad is
overly reading into it i don't think
people are like
making something up but there's like a
weird tension between the two
this is given a one i i think this is a
pretty solid one yeah this is a bad ad
i don't like him i don't trust him i
don't want what he's buying i don't want
what he's selling
research shows people remember
commercials with nostalgia
so to help you remember that liberty
mutual customizes your home insurance
here's one that'll really take you back
wow
what'd you get ryan it's customized home
insurance
from liberty neutral what does it do bud
it customizes our home insurance so we
only pay for what we need
and what did you get mike i got a bike
i'm impressed by so many of the ads i
see today this thing is
i mean this part is smart for
commercials people love the behind the
curtain [ __ ]
and they're telling you that it's they
tell you what they're doing they're
making fun of nostalgia and commercials
and they do it and then they
and so you feel like you're not being
marketed till you feel like you're in on
the joke
and they fit all in 30 seconds so it's a
great it's really good i mean this is a
four
easily yeah good votes this is this is
really good
i wouldn't i don't think i'd change
anything i obviously usually i have
notes or like i have a different ideas
what would you really change about this
ad what would you for a 30 second spot
for home insurance
oh i'm sorry i know what i would do yeah
sorry i shouldn't ask that
sorry i would kill the parents
well foolish of me i would kill them
of course yeah i would kill the parents
that would have that yep there we go
i'm so glad i asked you guys yeah
thank god i have twitch chat here
make the brother the present
yeah we'll have the parents die and then
we'll have the two brothers
stare in each other's eyes and call each
other the present yeah that sounds
really uh
good ideas chat you guys will be great
marketers one day
so romance
[Music]
you coming
why did we submit two ludwig ads
we don't need two we already did one
ludwig head
he can't he gave me the whole [ __ ]
thing yes first of all
as an american i'm offended that he
would ditch work for any reason
how will his corporate masters make
profits if he's not manning the station
at all times
okay he is what we call an essential
worker
whatever it takes i don't care if he
can't be with his family on christmas
and he has to be here in the freezing
cold
at a gas station somebody's got to make
money
secondly why is there like a romance
again what is the look here he just met
this elf
what is what is this playful flirtiness
why
why when he's buying the oreo do they
like sneak off to the back
so the way i think this out would be
funny is that this guy's a degenerate
and i mean that like not even as a joke
i think if this guy was like
like just like totally slacking doesn't
care
and the elf would be super cute like the
elf is like super innocent and cute
and they end up bonding at the end and
they they have an oreo they split in or
something like that
all the details in this are just like a
little bit off we don't like them
also this guy looks 40 i don't know i
also think the elf could look different
you coming and then why does he why does
he invite him
santa can't he's delivering what
flash forward 20 minutes and this guy's
just in a sled freezing
you guys gave this a three i think this
is a two
this baby's a two wait check this out is
the campbell's chicken soup bad from 98.
nothing melts away the cold like a
delicious hot bowl of campbell's chicken
noodle soup
candles suicide by campbells
hey the character finally died you guys
should give it a five
the character finally died uh yeah three
three
three but three but it's old so it's
iconic because you're the customer and
you're not a snowman
you can see the benefit well he doesn't
bold of you to assume
i'm sorry most of you aren't snowmen
there's a lot of good coke commercials
original polar bear ad coca-cola
the cgi back then holy [ __ ]
there's been an upgrade
[Music]
it's so simple humble beginnings indeed
humble beginnings this is an example of
every every pepsi that i'm talking about
why is this intro so long i want some of
that pepsi money i need it
exactly go give me that love you bye
[Music]
can we get our first zero that's what
i'm talking about though that's why i
have been so unimpressed with pepsi's
marketing
because this is this is their whole
strategy as of the past few years
actually for the longest time you see a
coco ad it's it's sweet and it's
heartwarming and it's got the polar
bears and it's like
it reminds me of your childhood and then
you've got cardi b's twerk shop
where you buy pepsi only because you
might have a chance to win cash
and then it has this like [ __ ] full
minute intro that's boring as [ __ ]
i think we landed on a zero or a cringe
for this one
there is a single soda ad that
can bring us all together this year
because it is
it is the thirstiest time of the year
let's
watch that ad the ad that really means
christmas in all of our hearts
is the third thirstiest time
oh he crushes the wine
of the year sprite let's go
let's go indeed sprite you know it
remains to be seen whether history will
look back on lebron for his basketball
achievements
or for his achievements in acting for
his great performance
as himself with this immortal line
want a sprite cranberry my god
i laughed i cried it's a perfect ad
but that's not for me to decide that's
for you to decide is it perfect
or is it flawless wanna sprite cranberry
it's so funny it's so funny because
it's just obvious they couldn't even get
him in the studio
it's a one tank jake first take
oh it's a 50 50. it's all it's perfect
by one vote it's perfect by one vote
boys thank you for watching marketing
monday this is a fun one
[Music]
oh
Cyberpunk's Billion Dollar Disaster - YouTube
today's topic
cyberpunk 2077 what the [ __ ] went wrong
what is happening and where is it going
let's talk about cyberpunk
here's what i want to say so the reason
i want to talk about this today
is because there's been a lot of big
business news about
cdpr you may have seen the news
or if you're like most people
you've consumed all your cyberpunk news
in formats like this giant yellow
squares with small black text on them
now normally this would mean delays but
instead
they dropped one to say dear gamers
first of all we want to apologize you
for not showing the game on base
last gen consoles before it premiered
and not allowing you to make a more
informed decisions about your purchase
and i want to dive into that real quick
you know i want to dive into that
because now they're offering refunds for
the ps4
why offer a refund for the ps4 we've
talked about overhyped games in the past
is cyberpunk the most overhyped game of
all time
and i think when you promise somebody
this and you give them
this there has to be
a reckoning there is a problem
that is how you get that is how you get
this the ps4 review
score this is a 9 out of 10 on pc it's
doing quite well on pc
i like the game let me let me open up
with that actually because i think it'll
make what i'm saying sound more
authentic
the truth is i've been playing this game
on and off stream i like it this game is
exactly what i was looking forward to
it's what i wanted
but no one can argue that this has been
handled well from a business perspective
nobody basically overall console
versions of this game they're extremely
buggy
they run at very low frame rates they're
almost impossible to complete at some
points with the story
a lot of games have been reviewed in the
past and made money what is it what does
it actually mean
so not only do you get review scores
like that
but you get this
and this is the most important of all
this is the real problem cd projekt red
has shed over 30 percent of their value
as a company that's
it's billions of dollars this has larger
implications than just one game being a
little bit buggy
there's a lot of reasons to go into this
but the first one i'm talking about is
first of all refunds
so people say okay the game is meant to
be on pc who who cares that they're
refunding ps4 and xbox versions
well when i took a look at the sales
figures
so i look at those and i found out that
60 of sales in the uk
were on ps4 and it was a record-breaking
launch
so it sold a ton and 60 of those people
bought them on ps4 people i've seen a
lot of
takes that are like nobody bought it on
console anyway who
cares a lot of people bought it on
console and a lot of people were hyped
for this game
to be good on console if you play ghost
of tsushima
or you play last of us 2 you expect that
you can get
good graphics and a good game on a
console
and when you buy into the hype over 8
years and you buy a game that is
unplayably bad you are gonna be furious
and for a company like ea they're giving
you this look
okay this is what ea say and you know
what
it is it is cdpr's
first time they're not they're not used
to this
the problem for cyberpunk is not sales
damage currently
it's still projected to sell over 20
million copies
this game did not sell poorly this game
sold amazingly
so why is the stock plummeting that's
what i want to get into
cd projekt red has made a lot of games
in the past okay this is not their first
rodeo with cd
with cyberpunk they have made the one
you all know and love the witcher 3.
this is the game that really got them
their claim to fame but they've made
a lot more than that okay they also made
the witcher 2.
the witcher 1. okay a good trilogy they
also made
the witcher adventure board game and
the witcher dlc and
the witcher uh battle arena is another
game they've made the witcher battle
arena is a great game
they also made gwent based on a card
game from
the witcher they also made thronebreaker
the witcher tales and another expansion
for the witcher 3.
and i think that about covers everything
they've made
up to cyberpunk i don't know if you're
seeing a pattern but
this has become one of the most valuable
game companies on planet earth
one of the most respected game companies
on planet earth
all off of one franchise this is the
only thing they've made
let me just show you this is it this is
every game they've made 2007-2019
i remember if you guys know hot shot gg
he's got a mansion in
la big pool in the back all these rooms
and i was looking around his mansion i
was like dude
your place is [ __ ] amazing this is
crazy you sold clg you're living you're
living
in this house that you own he bought it
over the ceo of spotify
literally it was him and the ceo of
spotify in a bidding war for the house
and he bought it
okay and he's living he's living large
and he's like dude he's like dude i
would literally give
all this up and live in a shack in
poland if i could work at cdpr and learn
how they do it
and that stuck with me i was like holy
[ __ ]
what a what a reputation they have
this was my brilliant summary
look at this look at this why is
cyberpunk
dead on arrival
wow look at that
look at that that's called production
value
it's not just the value of the money
they're going to make on cyberpunk it's
the value of their future profits from
their reputation
cvpr had a sterling untouched reputation
that allowed them to turn a game where
they hadn't revealed very much
into the biggest launch of all time
let's say they offer a new game let's
say their next game comes out
the chances of people falling for the
same hype are are much smaller
and after months of crunch all of their
actions leading up to the launch
instead of seeming mysterious or being
explainable away
all seem more negative in hindsight
cyberpunk 2077
runs surprisingly well on current gen
consoles this is 19 days ago
no it doesn't dude it doesn't
the other thing they did was they didn't
allow reviewers to use footage
from consoles in their reviews they
literally blocked it you were only
allowed to use trailer footage
you couldn't record your own footage
which means of course there was no
footage of the massive amount of bugs
let me say one more thing not to put too
much of my own self into this
but i have worked on a project marketing
related
with cdpr people and they were top class
i work with a lot of marketing people
and a lot of them don't
they have no risk appetite they can't
think of cool ideas they don't know what
their fans want to hear
they they're bad these guys were great
they were fantastic
they are very good at marketing and if
the product had matched up it would be a
win-win
you can't blame the marketing guys for
doing their best job what they've
realized very quickly is that
reputation is everything
your brand is everything
losing your brand means you're just
another
you're a dime a dozen developer there's
a lot of developers out there and the
only way you get that excess value that
makes them one of the most valuable
companies in the world
is the brand this is a great quote that
i really respected
the cost of fixing cyberpunk 2077
is irrelevant compared to restoring the
company reputation
and i i like this a lot so they're doing
refunds
they're doing massive bug fixes which
probably means more crunch i feel bad
for the developers dude
they have to do insanely quick bug fixes
and help turn this around they're gonna
pull on no man's sky
there is no chance they just leave this
game buggy like ea would
cyberpunk will be will be fixed i
guarantee it they'll do everything they
can to
chug away this game until it's fixed i
mean it's gonna be well after launch
which kind of sucks this is what i'm
worried about
what do you see here this is fall guys's
steam chart
no one's playing now this is essentially
zero
this is at the bottom season one season
two
season three okay
because in today's modern games climate
unless your game is a
infinitely generating ugc multiplayer
game it has a very limited life cycle
but you're looking to get like red data
reduction 2
or watchdogs or assassin's creed
they all have instant fall offs do they
have a launch week and then they go
so most games have to get they get a
large book of their sales and a large
bulk of their interest and fan
excitement in the first week
and they've blown their first week
cyberpunk has out and out blown their
first week
they're gonna be doing uh gta style
multiplayer in some way
it's the way to sustain but
but because of the bugs because of the
launch
because of the uh blowback
all of their developer resources have
now shifted from multiplayer
to bug fixing they're not doing this
they're doing this
so the developers are going to be
working triple time just to get this
part back to
to working meaning this will be even
farther out
and so i'm very worried that cyberpunk's
hype is
already after eight years of hype
beginning to die down
the overall takeaway narrative is like
the game was buggy
and even if it gets fixed and they add
multiplayer
it's gonna be so difficult to get back
to where they could
have been so they have to do two big
things quickly
after years of crunch and i'm i'm not
sure they can execute it it's gonna be
the toughest time in the company's
history
should i buy their stock that's a great
question so that that is actually a good
uh sort of wrap-up question is
should you buy cdpr stock right now my
guess
it depends on how much you believe in
the company but i wouldn't
until they've proven they can solve
these problems without killing their
developers
a few episodes ago we made a list of the
most overhyped games of all time
and i said we'll see after launch where
cyberpunk lands
i think it's fair to say
after all of this cyberpunk 2077 a game
that i really like
that would probably give an 8 out of 10
so far is number one
most over hyped game of all time
i think that's fair to say now i took no
man's sky down
because it got fixed if this game gets
fixed i'll take it down
but right now at launch based on what
they said for eight years and what we
got
especially console players it's the most
overhyped game of all time
and i think the smartest thing to do for
my pov
would have been to release the pc
version now
because you get best bug feedback from
people actually testing it
so i think you released the pc version
now and said
console version coming in i don't know
february
march right here ps4 be mad it doesn't
come out but they'll be fine
because when they get it when they go to
best buy and they buy the physical copy
and they put in their disk at home it
works and it is not a miserable
18 fps experience if they say your
game's great but i can't play it that's
one thing
but i mean but it's not out but if they
say
i bought your game and you ripped me off
you committed fraud on me i hate you
i'll never trust you again that's an
entirely different thing
okay one of them is easy to bounce back
from the other one isn't that's the
marketing monday
cdpr godspeed dude and i pray
can we all have a moment of silence for
the cdpr programmers
who are on their 50th cup of coffee
working
bleary-eyed looking at the same monitor
little do you know how i'm breaking
while you
underneath it all i'm held captive
by the whole inside is a harder fight
little do you know i
need a little more time
need a little more time that's poignant
that's poignant and wise
all they need is oh my god she pulled
vodka out of her
ass how much more time do you need
she drinks it
uh and that's some guy's job right now
he has to fix the vodka ass bug
i pray for that guy damn it man i just
bought this game on pc today i want you
to know that i like this game
if you bought it on pc you're already
way better off than console and second
of all there's a lot to like
i didn't get into it today because it's
more of a business talk marketing monday
is about like
what this means for the brand for the
reputation for the stock
from a gamer protected as a pure [ __ ]
deus ex gamer
i love this game there's a lot to like
the stories are really fun
it's like wester dope driving around the
city is beautiful
rtx on i i love it but i'm not gonna not
be honest and say this was a good launch
this is a this is a really bad launch
and and you really really really
rarely get a brand as sterling as what
they had and so to tarnish it sucks
it's so hard to get that back a brand
that good is worth
it's worth so much

for worst attempt to respond to
coronavirus goes to
mcdonald's with their separating the
golden arches campaign
where they move the two sides of the m
apart
as a sign to social distancing and
everyone said
pay your workers more you [ __ ]
[ __ ]
everybody hated it and they ended up
having to take it down
what a bad bad ad camp just basically
two ends
a lot of time money and effort spent on
this ad
at one point a tweet ratioed them that
said [ __ ] right off
you award desperate morons the source of
my anger is that this is a disingenuous
scam to win awards
which would normally only annoy me but
it enrages me when the topic is a global
chem
pandemic and yet who's laughing now
because mcdonald's did win an award a
marketing monday
congratulations on the monday mcdonald's
wow awards secured wow

got ninja the blood himself
i mean i can believe it because we're
close personal friends but still no i'm
not gonna show bergs he's very camera
shy lately
he's actually feeling kind of depressed
yeah
yeah you guys know how it is you know
how you feel a little bit down
um and you're like worried about how you
look and
you know you feel like uncomfortable
other people but you still want their
friendship
you know like sometimes you don't want
to go out to a party but you'd like to
be invited
that's what bergsy sort of feels right
now i don't know if you guys i don't
know if you can relate to that or not i
don't know
but if you could consider uh priming
because all the primes go to him
focus please focus cameraman i paid 50
000 for this camera okay and you and you
and i hire you
and this producer and this [ __ ] team
and these lights can get the camera

mcdonald's took their first word well
but now it's time for our second award

for me to read the award for best
performance
by a content creator in an ad

one more great performance this year one
that
truly floored me truly stunned me and if

tim the tatman in his award-winning
performance as gamer on
tractor can we watch that one more time
take it to the house kid wow and i'm

a professional gamer that they somehow
got an nfl ad
i thought this is genius this is
avant-garde how does he do it
[Music]

of nadeshot and crew celebrating there
they are a hundred thieves
wow look at nadeshot and hex and uh
scuffy boy their main star they even put
the building

that's something congratulations hundred
thieves wow hundred thieves
still celebrating actually i was like
yes they are they're still
they're still so jazzed about it i want
to check picking on that later see if
they've calmed down a bit
the night never ends we have a fourth
award a lot of my awards
go to the huge companies the big games
the big marketers but we always put
one award in for the little guy
that's why this award goes to
the surprise indie
no marketing hit of the year a company
with that with no marketing budget
and no hype was able to create
a massive release i'm seeing hades in
the chat
i'm seeing among us in the chat
you're all close but this award goes to
cyberpunk 2077
a game that with no hype at all
was able to make a massive impact
i honestly hadn't even heard of this
game before it released this
year they spent almost nothing on
marketing i guess because i had not
heard of it
a tiny company based in poland
named cd something literally no i never
heard of them
came out of nowhere to win the world's
hearts
with this game in fact we ran the
numbers
this game had only a mere
nine million pre-orders
only 9 million pre-orders
only 9 million pre-orders
only 9 million pre-orders
wow wow wow
what a game what a game what an
indie game thank god they didn't over
hype that you know
because the way it came out just sort of
low key under the radar
building an audience i found to be super
impressive
and really earned them a lot of goodwill
with the community
and with sony management
congratulations cd projekt red for your
first monday award
hopefully many more to come which are
four
i don't know the fifth award the award
for the worst ad that won a bunch of
so-called
real awards and the monday
goes to burger king for their
moldy whopper award what
the [ __ ] was this ad
what was this this won so many awards
and it's so terrible it showed a
disgusting
filthy moldy whopper all you're gonna
remember
is how filthy disgusting this burger was
why would you ever want to go to burger
king after you see this
the whole argument about the beauty of
artificial preservatives
of not having them means nothing when
all you're gonna remember in the part of
your brain that uses visual memory
is that it's disgusting what a truly
terrible ad
not only that but at least in the
commercial you see the process you get
the idea oh there's 30 days between when
it gets old
still disgusting but the billboards
were this this was the billboard
just a picture of a disgusting moldy ass
whopper
how did this win so many awards this
year i'm i'm
i'm baffled as a marketer i'm so baffled
everyone's like oh it's so clever
so edgy this is the most award-based
terrible ad i've ever seen in my entire
life and as a marketer i'm disgusted
also as a person who likes to consume
food i am disgusted
so i mean bergsy himself had to vomit
bergsy had to vomit when he saw it
bergsy hated it before we jump in though
i want to see how our first
round of award winners are still doing
let's check back in one more time
on 100 thieves yes
they are still just as excited as when
they first got the monday
100 thieves wow
love to see it and now it's time to get
into that back half of the awards
starting with award number six i'm sorry
this award is for
the actually kind of based award for the
brand that was actually kind of based
it's also slash brand tweet of the year
award
it's a double whammy lot of big
contenders in this
but it does go to steakhouse
steakhum slice steaks
for this series of tweets let me pull it
up for you
on april 6 during the height of the
pandemic
they posted this seven part
thread on the importance of fighting
misinformation
about what good data is about what
outliers are
about how difficult it can be to find
sources of truth
during a time of institutional trust you
might be saying yourself patriarch
yes that is a very base tweet it really
is
but did it move sales
we care about sales here on marketing
monday good question
here's the answer yes
in fact when i looked into the results
of the stakeholm's misinformation
campaign not only did they
double their following count on social
in one month
which is literally unheard of but
they increase traffic to their purchase
website
by 435
in the month of this post 435 percent
what is most important about an ad like
this is it cost them literally nothing
they could just type it and it went
viral so congratulations for one of the
first
uh positive mondays goes to stakehomes
for a great award uh and a great
based tweet deserved brand tweet of the
year we enter the final four
and if you guys are fans of marketing
monday awards
the mondays then you know
the final four are our most important
awards these awards
begin with the worst ad
of the year there are so many bad
marketers out there
who spend all year making terrible ads
hoping to one day win the monday
to qualify the ad must have released
during this calendar year
and again let me say this was a year
of a global pandemic where almost every
brand
was tone deaf almost every brand
said these uncertain times instead of
saying anything real there was a lot of
bad ads
plus there's the entire nation of canada
who churn out bad ads with a grace and
poise that is unheard of
but to be truly terrible to stand out
you can't just be a badad
you've got to be a [ __ ] annoying one
and that's why the worst ad of the year
goes to an ad released in january
before the pandemic facebook groups
kazoo i present to you now facebook
groups kazoo
hold up y'all kazoo well get on up here
i looked at a lot of ads to determine
the worst out of the year
and when i think back to make an ad this
bad in january
is truly impressive but what i think is
extra based about this ad
it's not only annoying as [ __ ] it's not
only a terrible message but it
secretly predicts facebook's plan for
ruining america
look here's a scientist trying to say
something important
to a class of students americans this is
facebook
[Music]
randomly playing kazoos drowning out the
scientists trying to speak
random misinformation
then they run outside and abandon
education altogether
getting the entire country screaming
noise at each other
instead of any meaningful dialogue
public service starts to break down bus
drivers no longer work
civil servants no longer can do their
job because of facebook and the kazoo
then this house which represents the
very foundations of america
starts to crack under the pressure of
all this misinformation
and noise
[Music]
and what do we do we turn to instagram
when facebook has torn the world apart
we go to celebrities on instagram
later this year a lawsuit
filed by over 40 u.s states by the u.s
government the us government is now
suing facebook
for being a illegal monopoly and i read
the lawsuit took months to prepare
and i like to think it took exactly
11 months because they started it the
second they heard this
terrible ad so congratulations facebook
for making the worst ad of the year
hopefully getting you broken up into a
thousand little pieces you [ __ ] robot
mark zuckerberg man of the year
the marketing monday man of the year
this is a gender neutral award but it
dates back to the 1960s
it is the overall most important person
in marketing for the year 2020. i almost
don't want to read it
so many hearts will get crushed so many
people's lives
have been worked to the bone to try and
win this award
but only one man or woman
did it with the poise and grace and tact
necessary to be this marketing monday's
man of the year that's why the award
goes to
travis scott travis scott is the man of
the year for marketing
because he partnered with literally
every goddamn brand on the planet
travis scott travis scott
started this year and said you know what
i don't care
he's actually wait he's gonna accept the
award himself hey
yo what's up what's up guys yo
it's me travis scott what up what it do
bet you know it's lit it's so lit
and i'm so excited that i won this award
for the monday you know what it is what
it do i just like to thank all the
6741 brands i partnered with this year
each one means a lot to me i definitely
don't do it for the money
i do it because i love the brands love
them
love the brands love every single one of
them all right
get your cactus jack meal from
mcdonald's
buy a ps5 uh watch fortnite
you know what it is what it do all right
that's me travis scott i'm out
nobody defined marketing more in 2020
than travis scott
an age of total sellouts
the next award goes to the single
greatest ad
of 2020. best ad
2020 so many
great ads to choose from we've reviewed
many of them right here on this very
show
off it on a tuesday obviously could not
be sprite cranberry though because that
was not came out this year
obviously stop asking stop saying trump
camera because it couldn't be
it wasn't this year but it could be any
ad
released this year facebook groups kazoo
perhaps
and the marketing monday the monday for
best ad of the year goes to
frames win games frames win games
kidding kidding kidding kidding kidding
kidding kidding
the best ad of the year truly and i
looked at a lot of them
was nike's you can't stop us ad now
their entire campaign was amazing
you've probably seen the ad i'm talking
about here where they did the split down
the screen
but but i found that ad
to lack a certain heart it was the best
edited ad i've ever seen in my entire
life
the other nike ad from this campaign the
comeback kid ad
i think is the best ad of the year the
most compelling the most on brand story
and now we're gonna watch it
we've all been underestimated and
counted out
in those moments we felt like it was
over and then we did what no one thought
we could
not even ourselves
[Music]
we came back from the impossible over 52
years
from being broken right now
we're fighting for something much bigger
than a win or championship
but if we learn anything from sports
[Music]
is that no matter how far down we may be
we are never too far down
to come back boom baby
i thought that was a fantastic ad for a
lot of reasons
i think it was one of the first ads to
feature corona that didn't feel cringe
they didn't overstep its bounds as a
brand from a marketer's pov it's
actually very hard for a brand to get
involved in any serious conversation
without being like
shut the [ __ ] up brand and i found they
did it pretty well there's funnier ads
there's more emotional ads but i think
that one felt
truly nike while still being a powerful
ad only barely edged out friends when
games though i'll tell you that
that leaves only one award
remaining one final award
and for this final award
for the grand finale i couldn't be the
one to read it
we got a special guest ludwig ogren
you may know him professional among us
player
will present the award the final award
for marketer of the year let me give you
one preface before we jump to this
he was provided not with a script
but with certain talking points sure why
wouldn't you give someone some talking
points
he told me he would read the talking
points
on one condition that i didn't watch his
video beforehand
so i haven't seen what we're about to
watch
now he knows who the winner is
so hopefully he delivers it correctly
hopefully he doesn't say any gamer words
but i have not yet seen what we're about
to watch don't get canceled don't get
canceled
don't get cancelled let's get to it
without further ado
is this recording this is so dumb um
okay just read the words as written hi
uh hi i'm i am ludwig ogren okay
and you may know me from doing
unimportant things like playing
children's games for money true well
today i'm finally doing something
meaningful with my time
wow uh i present the award for the real
heroes of society the marketers
yes i wasted time raising 200 it was 260
000
for charity uh these guys were something
more important
awareness yes uh so without further ado
the award for marketer of the year goes
to
okay i'm pretty sure this is a typo
because
my marketing for pokemon week would fail
and i'd get under 50 people going off
script
going off script it was so incredibly
right a little bit off script 100 000.
a little bit off script
can't even read the bold lines of my
beautiful marketing effort
uh well no winner this year
unfortunately
and no he's wrong and he's wrong there's
a lot of way congratulations no
it doesn't it doesn't we're a close
second error
oh there he said it at the end atriac is
marketer of the year
wow wow wow wow atriox
wow this is an honor and a privilege
holy guys i did not expect this oh my
god i'm floored
oh i'm floored i'm stunned and dare i
say it i'm chuffed
to all the brits out there i'm i'm right
proper chuffed
takes a lot out of you it takes a lot of
courage to get on marketing
uh to get on twitch every monday and
talk about marketing
or tuesday and uh some people said it
couldn't be done
people said oh megalo are you trying to
be devin nash
but after a year almost of
putting in the work in the trenches
to bring marketing content to you the
viewer
it feels great it brings a tear to my
eye
to be named your marketer of the year i
will treasure this marketing monday
award
this monday for as long as i may live
because not only does it mean
that my work as a marketer has value
permanently no matter what
but it means i'm something of a hero
little do you know
how i'm breaking while you fall asleep
so if you support the vote i'm still
hungry i'd like to see some sevens
i'm ready to forgive you but forgetting
is
a harder fight little do you know
i need a little more time
[Music]
and that my friends is the end
of the marketing monday awards i hope
you enjoyed
hope you laughed i hope you cried i hope
you sent a strongly worded letter to
facebook
tune in again next year
for the return of marketing monday
season

These Life Advice Tweets went viral... - YouTube
hey truck i'm nine years old and looking
into streaming
looking into streaming i am very
motivated i want to be famous like
ninja from fortnite any advice this is
the most important question i've ever
been asked it's powerful
and you've clearly put a lot of thought
into it here's my first piece of advice
forget about ninja ninja
you're nine ninjas 29
why are you watching this stream what
you need to be looking at
is a king called tommy in it aka
the ninja of the youth today's marketing
monday is about the best
business life and startup advice
that i've heard in a long time powerful
advice that i think inspired me when i
read it i think will inspire you guys
and hopefully we can talk through it in
a funny and interesting kind of way
that's all we're asking hopefully we'll
go out a little bit more intelligent a
little more thoughtful than we came in
that's all i'm trying to do so this is a
thread by nick
hubner at sweaty startup a man who did a
unique i believe storage startup
and got a figure exit so he did pretty
well
he dropped what i think is the single
greatest advice thread on twitter
you can decide we're gonna go through it
he starts off by saying
i've gotten a lot of bad advice in my
career and i see even more of it here on
twitter
time for a stiff drink and some truth
you probably don't want to hear which
starts off a little bit edgelord i was a
little bit worried when i saw that i was
like okay
we don't need a stiff drink for your
[ __ ] tweets the first one is college
isn't worthless for everybody
all successful folks who tell you
college is worthless went to college
what does that tell you it's not about
the learning though it's about growing
and learning on circles and ideas
so let's talk about this right off the
bat this is one of the harder ones of
the thing
i don't besides i personally know
multiple people especially who worked at
twitch who did not have college degrees
and they made it to work at twitch and
they worked fine
i also know for a fact that almost
nothing that i learned in college
has been useful in my real life so
that's that what i do say often on my
stream
the degree helps the degree helps and i
know this because i've hired people
and i've looked at resumes and just
having the degree
is often a way to get your resume
through the first fit like
do you know what i'm saying the power is
just the certifications miami
is not the next tech hub now i don't
know if you guys have seen this if
you're not on [ __ ] tech twitter it
probably doesn't even
register in your brain this probably
doesn't even bother you at all
but if you've been on tech twitter there
are so many [ __ ] people talking about
oh i'm moving to miami we're gonna start
startups in miami
miami's gonna be and it's like that
sounds so stupid
miami's gonna be underwater dude in 20
years and the reason is because of taxes
because they hate the politics of
california
i'm not for all of it but
in general a lot of it is like i just
don't want to be taxed to pay for other
people which is
okay uh not a good philosophy
construction costs are insane because of
hurricane codes vacant land doesn't
exist property insurance has arrived in
understand 20 for the past
five years so this thing nobody talks
about
dude this happened to california too i'm
gonna try to explain it really simple
businesses will not buy a building or an
office or anything unless they can get
insurance on it they just won't it's too
risky what if there's a hurricane if
there's a fire
the problem is insurance companies are
like yo these places are getting more
and more risky every year
so insurance rates go up california's
because of fires
if you want to buy a house in california
and get fire insurance
it has gotten so expensive that most
companies won't even offer it
and so the government stepped in to do
like this fake fire insurance because
you need it
so if there ever is like a catastrophic
fire or hurricane it's gonna be a
problem
starting a bit this is the first real
piece of advice i thought was like oh
damn
okay starting a business is not right
for everybody
95 of folks are better off getting a job
it's hard as [ __ ]
decisions are critical and plentiful
risk is for real stress can be crippling
delegation could be impossible if you're
a poor communicator most folks don't
have what it takes
this is legit advice people who tell you
to start a business
are not thinking about what that means
it means a lot of [ __ ]
stress and by the way having a job
that offers you the money to do things
you enjoy it's not a bad thing
you know i think people are like man i
should just quit this job and start my
own business
theoretically you could but don't do it
because you're stressed
because chances are to get a business
off the ground is going to be
more stressful i think you guys are
misinterpreting steel chats ideas for
your job brilliant give me an idea right
now
give me a marketing idea your films
i want to steal it what's your idea
frames when games that's my idea
you made this i made this nvidia
graphics
trading cards
a stupid idea i would never ever write
that down in my phone and bring it to a
pitch later
i would never open up my notes app what
what was it again it was so stupid
nvidia and video
graphics trading cards you said what a
i'm putting it in my dumb column
technology isn't far as far along as the
media makes you think it is
we're five years away from autonomous
vehicles alexa still can't play the song
i want a quarter of the time
let alone make decisions and learn
robots follow their faces when they're
not perfectly flat on
flat on the ground this is also true and
i think people uh
i think we intuitively know this though
this is not like a game changer
if you look you can find articles from
five years ago
saying we're five years away from
autonomous vehicles
so they were wrong you can find articles
from 10 years ago
saying we're 10 years away from vr being
a mainstream thing
you can find a lot of articles where
they're like it's it's just five to ten
years away and like that
usually ends up being longer okay real
estate is not a good place to start
this is based because boomers and
your parents will tell you that they
think this is the good investment advice
buy a house get a starter home real
estate is not a good place to start
building your your investment okay if
you have if you have rich parents or
you're already gigantically wealthy
yes you can buy a bunch of land and
buildings it is a very slow way to start
to make money extremely slow
and also assets are a bit of a bubble
right now someone in chat put it more
succinctly than me they put homes grow
at four percent
you can invest and get 10 percent let me
tell you something if i'm gonna flex
by the way this is i actually shouldn't
say this this is against everything i
stand for
because it makes you do the wrong thing
but i'm happy about it i made
12 grand today off of my neo stock
12 grand today okay
now does that mean you should pick a
random [ __ ] stock
no i don't it's luck this is still luck
i wasn't a genius
it says people g pick a random stock
all in on tesla yeah all right you guys
have my advice yeah that's the real
advice today is take all of your money
and your mommy's credit card
the real thing is to get mommy's cc and
those three little
cute numbers on the back type that into
robinhood
uh oh buy otm options on
tesla expiring next week boom
suddenly you guys got a house in the
hills
uh now the [ __ ] big one chasing your
passion is a bad idea
and it's the best way to end in
heartbreak imo
if you're passionate about it so are
other people it'll be competitive as
[ __ ]
you're more likely to make emotional and
bad decisions
chase opportunity now and your passion
later damn dropping a truth bomb
i've phrased it a different way in that
i think passions change
passions are very whimsical i was
extremely passionate about starcraft
and league of legends professional play
and if i told myself this is what i have
to do this is my dream
if i because literally at one point i
was grinding league
15 hours a day and eventually thanks to
uh the failure of ipl six i
became i decided to go to the marketing
side the business side which worked out
quite well
and if i had said no no you know what my
passions league i need to be a pro
player
then the best i could have done probably
is make it to the lcs
be in a season or two and then get cut
for a better player from korea
right that's probably what it would have
been i would have wasted two more years
i'm just saying passions change i'm not
i don't i don't even like league
i i [ __ ] would rather [ __ ] gouge
my eye out with a spoon than play
[ __ ]
15 hours of league now your passions
change so
what i would say and as i always say
is that getting good at something is
much more fulfilling getting good at
something
makes you passionate about that thing
and also gives you that center
that reduces anxiety so that's that's my
advice on that and uh his advice is
basically a little bit more market
oriented it's that
if you want to open up a trendy bar
there's a lot of people that want to do
that because it's cool
so it's very competitive your margins
which is the difference between what you
what you bring in and your cost
basically your profit
are thin in a competitive industry you
don't make very much fat margin
that's why this guy went into [ __ ]
storage storage is competing against
old lazy businesses like who's that
what's the one with the orange key that
has like every [ __ ] storage center
anyway rent a center things like that
old lazy businesses he used tech and did
a little bit better and made a bunch of
money because no one's going into it
less competitive so going for
opportunity first things that
jump out to you and making a little bit
of money and some connections and
getting established
helps when you want to chase your
passion later so getting rich quick
isn't possible
[ __ ] have you met ludwig have you met
ludwig nick hubner i [ __ ] met that
kid when he was broke as [ __ ] like
two years ago broke as a
joke demands in a two million dollar
mansion now
you can get rich quick this is this is
isn't possible it's crazy
it is unlikely that is fine isn't
possible it's crazy we know
billy eilish got rich quick that's
possible but
it's just not probable and it shouldn't
be what you bank on
the media tells you the stories of the
overnight successes but that's all
[ __ ]
it gets clicks but it doesn't work the
way for nine percent for six folks
okay he actually brought it home a
little bit in the end but i think
in general it's possible giving up
is often the best choice there is too
many people drag along projects with
poor odds of success
far too long i like this idea
it can be taken the wrong way like if
you have a new year's resolution to go
to the gym more
giving up is not the best choice there
is and you're like oh wait it's hard
this kind of sucks
no no that's not
it's like if you're like i'm going to
start an instagram for my dog
that's going to be how i'm going to make
money and then like a month in
you got 12 likes and people don't think
your dog's that cute
you know maybe that's when you stop
doing the project
that's when you give up changing your
mind doesn't make you look weak it makes
you look better
true true maggies
if i'm in a conversation with somebody
and i make a good point
and they go actually i haven't thought
about that you're right i want to
marry them i want to change my opinion
so they're right
if they do that it is the it is the
chattest thing
it makes them seem like such a [ __ ]
chat i
honestly i always go like yo
actually you know what i i like
backtrack i'm
if they double down i get hardened in my
position i'm like yo you're [ __ ]
wrong you're an idiot
but if they go you got a point this is
and then i go well actually you know
what you were right about this too
like literally changing your mind is a
chad thing to do
um don't feel like you have to win
most arguments because you're wrong
about most things
as most people are because we're all
stupid we're all dumb stupid apes
so you're wrong about most things and so
be ready to change your mind sorry
this is it today's marketing monday
let's go into the winter before you sent
me so many

one of these companies will be marked as

The Funniest Commercials Ever | Marketing Monday - YouTube
hey yo it's good to see you hello hello
hello hello hello hello
today is marketing monday we have a good
topic for you today it's not the one
that you expect but it's one you'll
probably find even more entertaining
the reason today's marketing monday is
this
i was reading as i do ad week at age
all the ad based subscriptions uh that
i'm subscribed to
most of the articles they put out are
dog they're pretty bad
i have to filter out the good from the
bad and one of them was particularly
egregious
okay one of them was about what was
quote unquote
the funniest ad of 2020. i was like oh
the funniest ad we i need to laugh right
now
today's marketing monday is about
the funniest ads of all time beginning
with
this particular ad i would love for you
guys to take a look and tell me
maybe we'll watch this ad and think it
can't be topped
it can't be topped it's so good to see
you guys han out here
are we on yet i thought we're doing a
zoom thing
confused
is that the funniest thing you've ever
seen in your entire life
uh so this may be furious understandably
this this article
from a respected uh from ad week dude ad
week is like one of the longest running
uh marketing uh publications and they
have like a team of editors and they put
this stuff together and they do studies
and they
review consumers and i'm like damn that
cannot be the funniest thing
it just can't be although someone in
chat said conor's going to starve
because the guy has no pants
[Laughter]
connor got hungry i think the target for
this
is obviously gen x and boomers
and to prove that i actually i did some
further digging
so uh ace metrics is a it's a market
research firm
and you can if you pay for the
description which i do you can see
they do uh consumer tests
they'll get a bunch of people into a
room and make them watch an ad and give
their get their thoughts and reviews
these are actual quotes from people who
watch that ad
okay uh this ad made me
crack up i could totally relate to the
guy thinking it was gonna be a zoom call
great humor funny characters and i love
snickers candy as well
that's a male 36 to 49.
said that he couldn't relate to the
characters
it's 15 seconds long
it scored off the charts on funny and
love it
and inappropriate so today
today because i was so baffled and
shocked
by their review of the funniest ad i
thought i was gonna get my own review
give me your votes for the snickers ad
please
and that's exactly where i think it
belongs careerbuilder.com
monkey business sales aren't up there
they're down
on a new job we've got the most
careerbuilder.com
it wasn't just funny for this
for the sake of being let random the
whole point of their business
is that you think your job sucks you
want to find a new job you go to
careerbuilder.com
i think i think it's good i think it
hits their theme and is
humorous so it's good i i like where you
guys put it it's a smiley face
let's watch it discount grocery album of
the year
holland state of mind with all the
freshest tracks like
bananas bananas
[Music]
so fresh and check out banger bag it up
back it up hauling state of mind is the
definitive discount collection
is that canadian people are saying
canadian what the [ __ ] is no frills
is that canadian give me your review i'm
already ready real album
wait really all right wait this might
i'm gonna give this song is it chase for
you to swear your opinion and this
is the song

this man was fired
oh money you spent on this was a waste
welcome to the cringe tier dairy queen
i'm a fan of john
that's not real is it they edited that
yes ah nice i also want to be like damn
actually [ __ ] bass
i see some zoomers asking is that real
it is and it's the reason
it's one of the primary reasons quiznos
is dead today
they spent millions on this national ad
campaign
that was designed to i guess appeal to
the new internet
interested youth it was an
absolute disaster off-putting to
everybody
i see these as a comedy central all the
time
you guys are ruining the sanctity
you know what's funny these ads may have
been ahead of their time
you know to me as a young millennial
this was cringe as [ __ ]
it was terrible no one liked it if they
just waited
20 years
it's actually stupid enough that zoomers
might love it
make it a six second tick tock ad
[ __ ] it i'll trust your vote i think you
guys actually
ironically like it
[Laughter]
yeah i think it's funny and they said
the brand a bunch
so you're more i think if the movie was
coming out this would remind you it
exists
yeah to me that was funny oh i mean i
think that's got broad appeal
the highest honor it's in the highest
tier all right let's show you my
girlfriend's favorite
all right i want to show you ari's
favorite ad
southwest airlines want to get away
want to get away now you can with
southwest fares as low as 59 dollars one
way yes to low fares
that's transparency um i think it boosts
up in her opinion because of the dog
and also it's like um it's not too
tryhard you know it's a fun little
i i i have a vibe i think we both have a
vibe where an ad is
i don't know if it comes off as too over
the top try hardy
just to turn off this one wasn't this
has 372
wait is this going to get me banned it
says terry bogart slapping
and getting karma
[Music]
real ad wait that's a real ad
i thought that was a machinima sorry
this is going straight to cringe
[Music]
no no no not real it's not
[Applause]
is that real no way right oh my god wait
it might be real
uh what this was was doritos are the
competition
for a fan submitted ad and this was one
of the winners but they couldn't put it
on tv
first of all i think we notoriously know
that doritos is sort of a gamer
gamer food you know having doritos
crumbs already
is a it's a classic pro gamer move and i
guess it's
promising these lonely gamers that that
a cute girl's gonna
[Music]
lick your pants because you like
it's cringe dude anyway but hey
far be it for me to get in the way of
democracy r.i.p
the great one let's see
espn ad right stand back john have a go
at the size of this beauty
mate
i'll have him subscribe any minute now
i'll catch up with you later
john give us a hand here's what i'll say
uh
i know that we're all gonna give this
smiley face because it's steve our own
and we [ __ ] love steve horn
i think this is unironically funny and
actually in my mind
the this is sportscenter series of ads
is probably one of the funniest ad
series in the history of
tv and since tv is dying it might end up
being one of the funniest ad series of
all time
easily going into the top of the top
all right kmart this is the kmart
commercial now kmart's
dead in the water
so let's give him the best we can and
review their commercial
[ __ ] my pants right here
[ __ ] my pants you're kidding you can
ship your pants right here
you hear that i can [ __ ] my pants for
free wow i just may ship my pants
yeah ship your pants billy you can ship
your pants too i can't wait to ship my
pants dad
i just shipped my pants and it's very
convenient very convenient
it's funny it's funny because
it's so terrible for the brand
like they already have a low quality
brand
and they just associated it with your
pants over and over
for an easy joke that's funny to me
it's fun
maybe we can make one person laugh and
come into our store
yes it will truly tarnish our already
destroyed brand
beyond repair but
[Music]
it'll be worth it if even one person
says the name
k-mart i'm actually crying
i'm actually crying reese's take five
what's that reese's take five bar
chocolate peanuts caramel peanut butter
pretzels never heard of it where have
you been under a rock
new to me what were you born yesterday
oh
trish none of us have heard of take five
so who looks stupid now
reese's take five the best bar you've
never heard of
the whole point is take five is
forgettable
and the ad is forgettable the it doesn't
help
so uh yeah we're gonna we're gonna have
to drop this exactly where we thought it
would go
funny condom commercial i'm interested
[Music]
where are you guys at someone said
average walmart
that's pretty good something advertisers
are afraid to do
kids are always cute kids are always
sweet kids are always heartwarming
calling them annoying little sh is very
rare in an ad
yeah it's good it also you got to think
so who's the target market for condoms
uh probably teens early 20s having sex
don't want to get pregnant
right this ad appeals to that age grange
whoever a chat said me
don't that's sad come on you guys are
not buying condos let's be real
come on come on facebook mom's buying
more condoms than you guys let's be real
let's relax get cracking eggs
for dinner yeah i thought we would try
something new
that's weird it's not weird your pants
are weird
eggs for dinner isn't weird you're weird
for thinking it's weird
wait this was canadian again
how was it every single time
holy sh it was it was kind of a joke to
begin with
i think i'm on to something dude do you
guys know what marketing is do you know
the point of it
it's like your aliens who like learned
about marketing from watching it from a
distance you're trying to imitate it
we'll just pop this over here
perfect let's see let's run a bud lights
on me all right thanks steve
yo steve fist bump is out man really
what's in
cool
you saved the account
if you're worried that i'm being biased
right now just know that if you love
this ad i am
roaring uh yeah this is right where i
thought it would be it's just kind of a
it's a meh a minute long
high production value high res behold
the bounty of earth this is the
cube of rubik this simple puzzle was
actually considered unsolvable
by the humans uh they had chia pets just
like we do
and this is the white and gold dress
that caused the civil war but
most amazing of all are the avocados
from mexico they're always in season so
you can enjoy them all year long it's
just you know none of the jokes have any
punch like
at all at all like not even
like the cube of rubix people couldn't
solve it
airlines suck yeah that's relatable
i think you guys put it in the right
spot i i generally agree
17 seconds no rules here's your hot and
ready pizza
no calling no waiting
there's no rules what's your shirt back
home there's one rule
pick up a large hot and ready pepperoni
pizza for five dollars
only at little caesars pizza pizza
so simple i think we're leaning towards
smiley face and i agree
simple you know what i like what i like
the most about it
it's a short as [ __ ] ad and they still
manage to fix in a lot of pictures of
the pizza looking good
that's what really matters okay oh this
is an interesting one a lot of people
want to see this one i want to hear your
guy's thoughts
let's get i want your honest thoughts
i'm not gonna i'm not gonna say anything
i'm not gonna laugh even i think it's
funny
i'm gonna be stone-faced just to get an
honest answer
we're gonna play it and we're gonna
review it and i want you guys honest
thoughts
you tried these berries and cream
starburst pardon me what kind of
starburst did you just say
berries and cream berries and cream all
the little lettuce buddies and cream
[Music]
damn dude i guess you had to be there
i like that ad dog i'm sorry
uh hey if my fellow boomers that gave it
a one
but i could see either a one or a four
and i i don't know if the
the humor is aged too well i won't die
on this hill okay
if you guys want me if you guys think
this is where i'll make my
custard's last stand i will die
for the berries and cream elf you know
what
maybe maybe you guys would laugh more if
i was like
i i i can get you guys some more i'm
sorry i'm sorry i figured it out i
figured it out i figured i forgot
hey guys look look look look look look
look patties and clean
it's ludwig
[Laughter]
it's ludwig
[Laughter]
all right you guys are getting it i'm
glad i was you know what it just took a
little we had to bridge the gap i'm glad
we could bridge the age gap
you know we can all find things funny in
different ways wendy's gets memes i
think we all know that wendy's
gets us they roast on twitter
like the memer oh eat spicy goodness
like a baoz the self ears they're good
gotta get a selfie so hot got a selfie
or selfie and the behind the times are
this sandwich is the bomb
[Music]
raise the roof
it's this funny when did this come out
it's funny because
the executive that pitched this is the
behind the timezer
like this is not the behind the tizer
dude
the person who thought selfie sticks
were the thing to make fun of it
i mean if it was like on purpose like
man let's make it so cringy people talk
about it
it's like impressive
i don't know like thinking raised the
roof is behind the times
it it's not just by the time it's
ancient it's
i can't if it was on purpose like if
they were like you know what we can
never make something
that's not dated so let's lean into it
then i then i think it's unironically
genius but i think it's actually just
cringe
and it looks like the votes agree cringe
taco john's yes we'll do another
submission from ari
she wants to talk about taco john's from
1996.
do you describe taco john's enormous
mucho grande tacos and burritos
to describe it
big grande
i'm bilingual
my girlfriend is latina so it's extra
funny when she found this i think it's
the one woman in the ad
what wait i'm sorry we already know this
is getting voted so i just want you to
see
big
what a delivery big
here this one's called little babies ice
cream by dylan we'll check it out
it's already off to an interesting start
there's good reason
for my glistening skin
and how i shine
[Music]
and how my pores are so clean and clear
there are two dynamics at play
one being the size of your brand okay
now look
if you're a baskin robbins this ad is
polarizing and not what you need you
already have a big established
well-loved brand
you're trying to maintain but if you're
a little babies ice cream and nobody
knows you
you have to break through you have to
find a way to stand out
your your other option is irrelevancy
so to me given the problems they were
probably facing
and their goal this ads effective
can still be cringe but i think it's
more effective
[Music]
uh definitely not uncommon on public
transport you're right
really gives you the authentic public
transportation experience you just need
one guy in the back with a
phone playing music out loud no
headphones all milwaukee you guys have
his cringe
because you're afraid of raw human
sexuality is that what it is
will ferrell in his prime let me i'll
grab that one in a second alright we'll
do this last one here it is
set fire to your hair
poke a stick
[Music]
be safe around trains a message from
metro
wow so tell me more about this zoomers i
hadn't heard about this but apparently
this has a lot of nostalgia
be safe around trains it was a mobile
game with a fun ad and people liked it
i don't know if i was like i was a
crying laughing emoji but i was laughing
that's some of the deaths and if i was a
kid i'd really like it feels like it
appeals to kids
kids are the most likely to be safe
brown trains i i'm considering this a
pretty much a win on all fronts
so though it made it's more of a smiley
face for me
i could see wanting to give it the
highest honors if you really like it
uh awesome yeah i like to end on that it
was a great song
congratulations to dumb ways to die the
final
entrant into the exclusive emojiometer
the greatest measure of ad talent in the
world
uh uh that's the end of marketing monday
if you came here for marketing monday i
appreciate you

PREDICTIONS 2021 | Marketing Monday - YouTube
boys are you ready i hope you're ready
for marketing
monday today's marketing monday
all right let's go today's marketing
monday
is predictions 2021
everything that's going to happen in the
upcoming calendar year
i have analyzed predicted
and now i will reveal to you the
marketing monday predictions 2021
for some of you it will look like this
with money flying from the sky
for others probably not before we jump
in i want to give a quick
disclosure this is important for both
legal
personal and moral reasons one is that
predicting is an
art not a science and the act of
predicting
and checking whether you're right or not
makes you smarter pretty in the future
i will not get all of these right but
it catalyzes the conversation it's
interesting and it's based in data so
hopefully we can learn something from it
i sort of organized this into what i
thought the years were so like this is
the year of x
so the first thing that i think is a big
trend that i want to get into
is that 2021 is the first year
where i believe millennials are hitting
their prime
so on the left you can see what
advertisers and news articles think
millennials look like
on the right you can see what you guys
think millennials look like
and uh what they actually look like is
broke
is broke as a joke this is what
millennials actually look like this is
the share of wealth in
uh in the globe of by age and purple
line
is under 40. this includes you guys
zoomers when boomers were under 40
they had about 30 of the uh of the
global wealth
uh but right now we have about five
millennials are broke as a joke and
let me be honest with you zoomers are
even broker
okay this is a bad trend people 55
and over have over 67 of
uh stocks real estate gold money assets
in general
most of that is owned by very old people
so you might be asking
why if i just told you that do i predict
that it's going to be a good year for
millennials
the answer is boomers are starting to
die
if you'll notice it has started to turn
this slope
and once the slope begins you cannot
curve back up
the average money as you'll see in this
bump right here is 29 and 30 which is
exactly where i am this is the largest
cohort of the population
which means that in 2021 i predict
we're going to see full force nostalgia
marketing for things that were popular
to this group of millennials final fant
everything that was popular basically 20
years ago
is about to become coming back in a
massive way
because as people are sad and lonely
nostalgia marketing rises like crazy
nostalgic marketing
is a tried and true way to remind you of
when times were better
when times are scary and sad we've
already remade all these kinds of stuff
we've already remade transformers and
now it is this this group's turn okay
and so we're getting
space jam two spaceship was 20 years ago
matrix four matrix was 20 years ago
okay i am predicting i'm manifesting
this into the world
i am telling hollywood executives that a
full batman beyond remake slash reboot
will be announced in 2021
guaranteed baby i actually think they'll
it hits a lot of the circles they're
looking for
i think they're gonna do it next up uh
let's talk about streaming
in 2021 the streaming winners will be
netflix and disney and everyone else
will lose there was a lot of talk in
2020
and 2019 that disney plus may kill
netflix
that was wrong netflix is not going
anywhere everyone is buying netflix and
they're not leaving
it is it's like a cable bill it's like a
it's like a utility bill it's
electricity or a light disney plus
came in with the largest backlog of ip
ever seen everything else all of these
are going to decline
none of these have the breadth of
content and the rate of new content
to uh to keep subscribers in the era of
churn
these dots represent shows okay and
these four boxes
represent how much like how excited
people are for these shows
so you'll notice a few shows are worth
like
hundreds of these average shows so like
the boys
the mandalorian the crown westworld
these few shows had demand that was like
hundreds x times more
than the average show disney if you'll
notice has is actually pretty light on
this
and that is why if disney had just stuck
with the mandalorian and all their
backlog
they might be in trouble they have
rectified that by announcing like
14 shows so they're coming out
next year guns blazing
i think disney was going to phenomenal
year uh peacock just to dive in
my predictions that peacock will be
canceled this year though i think
they're going to cut their losses as of
the end of 2021 their three tiers are
based on entirely how much the office
you can watch
this is pick your peacock and they say
you can have peacock regular which is
office season one and two
peacock premium which is every episode
of the office and peacock premium plus
which is the office
plus like bonus office features
literally the entire service is like
please watch the office more
just buy the dvds at that point there is
no reason
so get next up let's talk social media
every brand is gonna get ticked out yeah
every brand is getting a tick tock
if you're on tick tock and you like how
there's not that many brands on there
get ready every marketer is getting
ready to throw money tick tock
the growth rate has been absolutely
phenomenal
it did not get shut down despite all the
talk uh it's here to stay
its download rate is number one in the
app store uh another picture of 2021
and this one i'm really excited about
2021 is going to be the year of gaming
i want to ask you guys if you look at
this picture what do you see
not just girl gamers there's guy gamers
in there too no it's no
no no no you guys got it all wrong
you're seeing you all you see people
having fun
the answer is dollar signs that's what
the rest of the world is starting to see
from gaming
they're starting to see dollar signs
because
as you can see from this graph is now
massively
massively bigger than films or music
green is films this is 2021
green is films blue is music yellow is
gaming
okay the amount of money that gaming
makes dwarfs
all other forms of media so let's make a
gaming prediction
specifically on the console part ps5
rolls and smokes the xbox
everything that i've seen and again i've
done other videos on this subject where
i was a little bit more neutral
the data is clear everything i look at
is telling me
ps5 demand is like six times that of the
xbox
i could tell you about how even if
they're both sold out the ebay listings
for ps5 are going at like
three times retail while the xbox is
like 1.5 but what i'll tell you is i
watched this video
if you guys know there's a content
creator named erac he kind of blew up
this last year he's about a million
subscribers
he had a video where he put a ps5 and an
xbox and everything in ice
and people could break the ice to get
out this is just this is air rack he's a
he's a youtuber
and i was checking out this video and he
had a clip right at the beginning that
said it all
this is a ps5 the most desired product
on the face of the planet we also have
the new uh
xbox airpod
the most desired product on the face of
the planet
we also have the uh new xbox
he doesn't even know the name and you
know why because no one knows the name
because it's one of the worst name
products in the history of
marketing the ps5 has that airpods level
flex factor
so with all that combined ps5 demand is
is is rippering out of the gate they
also have more games out of the gate
xbox is waiting on halo which has yet to
materialize
literally the only thing that can save
the xbox next year is a phenomenal
like a world-class halo game and i'm
confident to make the bet against that
so
next prediction is that uh the streaming
wars
heat up heat up for two people twitch
and youtube
if you look at this graph you might
think wow facebook live it's not it's
only half of youtube facebook live
numbers
are absolutely fraudulent at this point
at this point i've looked at enough of
their reports
to realize that it makes no sense
they're putting in people's
feeds people are scrolling right past it
and they're calling it views it's not
real
youtube has seen steady growth and
growth at actually a faster rate than
twitch
and if you'll notice if you watch any
big creators you'll notice some of the
biggest creators
are doing not just fine on youtube but
amazing on youtube
for example tommy innit who's been like
the star of twitch lately
getting around 200 300k is still being
dwarfed by a technoblade
now there's a real competitor i don't
know what number i landed there's like
three or four
nuclear bombs i called of the streaming
war there are three or four features
that are just
what makes twitch and youtube way ahead
of the pack okay
one of those features that has kept
twitch at top is drops
the two killer apps for twitch are
twitch primed and drops
twitch prime is just amazon throwing
millions of dollars at creators
essentially no one else is willing to
bleed that much money okay
so prime is amazing no one can no one
can stop that like
youtube has no answer to prime but
youtube does have an answer to drops
this is my breakthrough 2021 youtube
builds their own
version of drops but this picture's from
today where they announced they're doing
something similar to drops in call of
duty
it works for valor it works for a rust
it works for everything if you're a
developer
and you want to launch your new game do
i launch it on youtube
or do i shoot with twitch where i can
bacon drops juice the viewership make it
the number one game guaranteed
people stream it no matter what and and
massively do it that way okay now on the
counter side
one of the best things youtube have that
twitch should steal is vods
if you guys are watching me right now
you're like wow what did he just say if
it was youtube
you could literally just click back in
the player you can just rewind live
and this watch all right it's an amazing
feature and i predict that twitch will
see that
and do nothing as they've always done
i predicted twitch will not
improve vod or discoverability at all
as a former twitch employee i feel like
this will hold true
again this is a small window this is
july to september if you
zoom this out i don't have a zoomed out
graph twitch viewership has tripled
okay the pandemic was massive for twitch
and youtube and live streaming in
general okay
it's been very good and so what does
that mean it means 2021 is gonna be the
year of the creator
creators of the at the top point one
percent are gonna have the most
amazing year because brands are starting
to realize
just how desperate they are to get the
audience that creators have got
on lock that's why it's growing
massively
in 2021 it grew i mean almost 50
if you have a giant youtube channel or a
giant instagram
basically anything but a twitter twitter
doesn't monetize
so sorry conor you're big twitter we
don't it's not that good
sorry conor now this i want to talk
about too
these are the top gaming streams of all
time if you'll notice
the most recent one from january of this
year is
greg who hit 2.5 million concurrence on
his uh
uh his fortnight skin reveal okay so
viewership is starting to get really big
and i think if you look at these numbers
like what does that mean
two and a half million viewers is a
little
over half of what the bachelor got which
was the highest rated show at 8 pm
now the bachelor is a show that
has
a gigantic cast a network behind it and
a team of ad sales
all of that and he is nearing what
that got on a premier night okay
mtv has about 770 k concurrence
on an average night that means dweme
with his 0.7
is basically equal to mtv we're getting
to the point where
single individual people have the power
of tv shows and tv networks
another interesting graph in this past
year in gaming is that rust and among us
both after years of no sales
use creators to make millions these
trends are real
okay you look at it look at rust 2014 to
2020. that's six years of basically no
growth
same player base then out of nowhere at
 five x's
okay because creators played it that is
huge amounts of money in their pocket
and people are noticing that
game developers are realizing that
streamers can make or break your game
my prediction is that streamers start to
realize their value
begin to start their own businesses
imagine if offline tv
built a among us competitor okay
they paid someone to make it they own it
and they stream it they all stream it
they're able to build a game that they
own
this is a bold prediction i'm not sure
it'll happen this year but i'm gonna i'm
gonna go ahead and put it on online i
think it'll happen
listen streamers make a lot of money
from subs but the amount of money you
would make from having a popular game
massively dwarfs that i'm getting i'm
getting closer to the final part of the
predictions i want to say
for this last part uh it's a sad warning
because i'm going to talk about some
trends
that are a little bit sad okay 2021 is
not all sunshine and rainbows especially
because most of us
including myself by the way are not
creators and uh i want to i wanted to
ask myself
why i thought this stuff was growing so
much is that we're entering
the year of loneliness because people
are looking for any solution to
this problem
people are just generally lonelier i
think they have generally uh fewer close
friendships i think they have fewer
close groups they can find
i think if you want to ask why if you
people get so mad at like stands
all this i think this is literally just
a human response
to ever increasing isolation people need
to belong in a group they need some kind
of human connection
and i think i think we're in an era of
of really extreme profound loneliness so
and also uh in 2020 we saw a massive
spike in anxiety and depression i don't
think it's going away at all
people are getting more anxious and they
are getting more sad these are real
facts
that we need to confront and address
ideally as
like a group of nations be aware that
you are not alone
if you feel this way you are you might
feel alone
you are actually among a very fast
growing group okay
it is not a rare feeling to feel a
little more isolated a little more alone
lately
i thought i would make my final
prediction and i think it's a powerful
one
one prediction that i think maybe can
turn it all around and that is
the tesla little pops tesla pops this
year dude
i know i said it last year i know i said
to you before that but this year it's
 done musk
you're going down dude there's no shot
by neo stock chinese tesla
and that is the end of my 2021
predictions
also i predict that i will get 100 000
subscribers on youtube
in um 2021 if
you could look into your heart and find
it in it to subscribe by clicking that
button below
i am on a quest a vision quest to
achieve 100
000 subscribers part time i think it
would be so sick
to get that silver play button
from flizz
okay it's all i want if you watch this
video
and you enjoyed it perhaps consider
clicking subscribe it would mean a lot
thank you
you
Jeff Bezos - YouTube
it is time to talk about game stonks
okay it's the story of the day let me
preface this by saying that i know for a
fact
that people are very emotionally driven
when it comes to this thing
so no matter what advice i give you you
won't listen
everyone's like we're all together and
then we get to the top someone's pulling
out with all the money and then you're
stuck holding the [ __ ] bag
because you bought in a thousand at peak
so that was what i said
yesterday that was when it was at its
high point
now i had no idea what would happen
today and that is why
i am changing my tune normally
i would be saying i told you so but i'm
not
because i'm actually quite pissed off
and in fact i'm
pretty sure this stock would have still
zoomed today
had they not pulled every trick in the
book
every sleazy underhanded
trick in the book so let me show you why
i need to explain what's going on
because this is how most of you sound
what's happening with gamestop
classic short squeeze what's a short
squeeze what's the short squeeze
it's us versus them there's a war being
waged against
the hedge funds the billionaires didn't
you grow up in a gated community
yeah and you know what i didn't really
feel that safe in it can we define
exactly what short squeeze is yes
they're borrowing the stock
the culmination of those elements
didn't you lose five thousand dollars
last week and
yes i did and what i gained was
invaluable true
she's not an income generating asset
i love her
that's a great video that was a great
video let's first
explain what a short is really simply
all right
[Laughter]
just kidding
just kidding but
a short is essentially a bet that a
stock will
go down okay so essentially let's say
ludwig stock
is at 100 okay
this is ludwig stock wow
he is worth a lot of money he's probably
gonna go down
because people don't want to watch among
us forever so he's gonna go
down cutie has a bunch of ludwig stock
so i'll say cutie i will borrow some of
your
of your 100 ludwig stock okay
and then you sell that stock you
immediately sell at the current price
and but what you tell cutie is i'm going
to give you this stock back at a certain
amount of time
so let's say she's got let's say she's
got 10 shares
all right she's got 10 shares at 100. so
i say cutie i'm gonna take
your 10 shares and i will give you
20 bucks for let me borrow them okay but
i guarantee i'll give them back to you
in a month i'm guaranteeing give these
back to you in a month
and i'm going to give you 20 bucks for
letting me hold on to them that's what a
short is okay
so i take her shares i sell them
immediately at 100
and then i hope that it goes down to
like 50 and then i just buy them back
for 50
i give them back to cutie she doesn't
know the difference it's the same stock
but i there's that difference there's
the there's the 50 difference that i
pocketed
okay it only works if the stock goes
down
if it goes up to 150 then i have to buy
this hundred fifty dollar stock
to give it back to cutie because i still
owe the the stock
you make money if the stock goes down
it's totally normal but what was not
normal about gamestop
what was not normal about gamestop was
the amount of shorts
gamestop was a company that was right
around here okay
between 20 and 50 a share that's about
what market value was at but right
around here
the shorts started getting so severe
and they were doing a lot of things to
pressure the stock to go
down okay and it got more and more
shorted and they got more and more money
and they got grittier and greater and
they kept shorting it because it was
downward trending
and so they all these big hedge funds
were risking billions
incredibly greedy to short it and they
were actually shorting as in borrowing
more stock than there was available
essentially it's called a naked short
when you sell it before you've even
borrowed it you're making a promise to
sell it and
that only works if it guarantees goes
down
it's called a naked short so which is
also illegal
naked shorts are illegal but there's
like loopholes that billionaires can use
to find a way to do it
and when it got right around here this
is not wall street bets yet
some smart investors like michael bury
of the big short
and he saw that gamestop was making
about the same amount of revenue as
chewy
but worth amazingly less and he's like
wow this stock is undervalued
ryan cohen i'm sorry ryan cohen so ryan
cohen was like wow
this stock is gamestop still makes money
gamestop is not dead right
it's not a [ __ ] growing company it's
not um
i would not bet on gamestop for the long
term but it's not
dead it's not going to zero so he's like
wow this stock is way undervalued so he
bought a bunch michael bury bought a
bunch
some smart guys bought a bunch and wall
street bets picked up on that
and they started looking into it and
they started realizing this thing is
so over shorted there are so many bets
this is going to go down
that if we start to make it go up even a
little bit they're going to have to
panic
when you sell what's called a naked
short
that means you have sold stock that you
don't yet you haven't even borrowed yet
you don't have it and so if it starts to
go up you need to
quickly cover that bet because it can go
up forever and you could lose a
bazillion dollars
so you have to buy stock you have to buy
it immediately so you have some to give
back that you borrowed okay
so with all of these people shorting all
these hedge funds
the stock started to rise and then the
hedge funds had to start buying the
stock
which made it rise more and made the
story seem true
so now wall street bets is more excited
so they buy more so the hedge funds have
to buy
more and they create this cycle that's
the gamma squeeze okay that's that i
mean
that's that's a short squeeze the last
time a short squeeze this big happened
you know you didn't hear as much about
this one because it was
professional investors doing it instead
of wall street beds and at this point
right here
when volkswagen hit the peak of the
squeeze it was the most valuable
company on planet earth for a moment but
the problem was now it was regular guys
a lot of them against a lot of
millionaires too by the way the average
people didn't make the most money off
this there's still millionaires fighting
billionaires
but anyway average people below
billionaires
were making tons of money off of this
okay and it was hurting
uh hedge funds billionaire billion
dollar rich people hedge funds and so
we got what happened today which i think
is one of the craziest
public scams in recent memory
the citadel capital who invested in one
of the major
people um doing the short here and is
also
one of the ways robin hood makes their
money let me explain real quick how
robinhood makes their money
people think robin hood makes their
money on the people's trades
they do not as they have there's zero
commission the reason rebelwood got
popular
was because there's no commission you
can trade as many times as you want they
don't take the money so how do they make
money
robinhood makes money by every time you
make a bet
on robinhood they sell the information
about that
to these major hedge funds is that legal
it is legal but it's very unethical it's
very shady
and there they go to great lengths to
not talk about it robin hood's largest
client
and largest customer is citadel capital
okay citadel pays robin hood enormous
sums of money
for the knowledge of what the traders
are doing on robin hood so
when they came knocking that's like
their boss i mean that's how robin hood
makes money
and they did not think of the customers
as their boss they thought of citadel as
their boss
and so they shut down trading which is i
mean that's blatant market manipulation
they stopped you from being able to buy
they only allowed you to sell
again like i said and this is why i
never believed in this even though i i
truly support
the general idea of you know
[ __ ] over some hedge fund people i
think that's super funny and i'm on
board
but as i said in the opening clip um
people don't actually have diamond hands
i'm sorry but they don't
despite what it seems like in the
smaller groups of reddit this is a broad
thing now
but i have to be honest here and this is
where people are gonna like what i'm
gonna say
if you are betting this money because it
is the
one chance you get sometimes
in your whole life to [ __ ] over a rich
hedge fund [ __ ]
and you don't care if you lose it [ __ ]
yeah dude more power to you
but if you do need the money if you
think oh this is how i'm gonna get the
money to pay for my
dad's surgery or this is almost
sure to end up losing you money i
the the odds are are not on your side
there are a lot of forces including
human nature
against you making out with the monies
and uh
and and at the end of the day gamestop
stock is not worth this much that is the
core thing that's the reason i didn't do
it
we're all just trying to be the first
one out we're trying to hold it long
enough
to [ __ ] them over but then the second
they get kind of [ __ ] enough
you have to pull out first or you're
left with nothing one more thing i have
to say
because people are um getting this wrong
a lot
so when you see gamestop stock at 193 or
even like
let's say 300 let's say it's at 300.
people were saying
wow it's more valuable than apple stock
apple stock's only 137.
that is completely wrong and i'm not
trying to make fun of you but
it's stupid as hell that's not how stock
works at all
okay the price is only comparable to the
to its own stock uh
apple is the most valuable company on
earth there's just more shares of apple
look at berkshire hathaway stock it's
worth 348 thousand dollars a share
that would mean it's more valuable than
amazon by like a hundred thousand times
you know what i'm saying it's just not
that many shares if there's only a few
shares they trade for a lot
if there's a lot of shares they trade
for a little but you add them all up
what's interesting what's most
interesting is that they were so
brazen about market manipulation
this story yesterday wasn't that
interesting to me it was like whatever
it was kind of fun
but i just knew that it would end up
with the average person holding the bag
which is probably still going to the
thing is they're not just greedy on
gamestop
they were greedy on amc they were greedy
on build-a-bear
they were gertie on almost any of these
like mall based stocks
that still have some revenue but are
declining and so today
they basically just called in all their
billionaire rich favors
to stop millions of average people from
being able to trade
which is so [ __ ] it's super
duper [ __ ] and you know what's funny
though the amount of money they save
today like the the hedge funds
if gamestop stock had mooned today they
would have lost literal billions
so like whatever pr nightmare that robin
hood gets
it they they would rather take that hit
than lose
literally 50 plus billion dollars i mean
now they could still lose it tomorrow
because what happened today
which was so cool which was so cool
was that people were so disgusted and so
unanimous in their anger like they did a
million one-star reviews on robin hood
that a lot of the um
places that stop people from trading
today are undoing it tomorrow
which means tomorrow we could be in for
another rise
now again my recommendation as always is
to stay the [ __ ] out of this thing
but if you believe in it and you want to
stick it to the man and you you don't
care if you lose your money
um because you could make some huge
gains um go for it
i mean tomorrow's the day so dogecoin is
completely stupid
dogecoin is entirely a meme there is
nobody shorting dogecoin
there is no rich guy to [ __ ] over it is
just everyone betting that the meme will
get bigger and they can sell
which is a ponzi scheme dogecoin is
worthless
anyone buying dogecoin is literally just
part of a ponzi scheme
they're just hoping someone else dumber
buys in later that's
it routers says 70 billion was lost
on gamestop short positions that's
[ __ ] awesome
the fact that they [ __ ] over the
shorts out of 70 billion dollars
but the thing is these short sellers the
contracts they have
all had the stock at like
like [ __ ] five dollars i mean when
they made these short contracts
it was like under 20 which means
they still have to that's what they
that's like what they borrowed it at
so even if it's at 100 they're losing
they're losing billions
they're losing billions and billions of
dollars even if it's here
why don't the hedge funds just hold on
so here's the deal
um when they borrowed it when they
borrow when they borrow the stock to do
the short
the contract they make because again if
i'm borrowing the shares from you and
i'm going to sell them
and and pay you back later uh we set a
contract
i give you some amount of money to
borrow them and i say i'll pay you back
in one month or one week or what
the contracts have of a date okay and
usually it's pretty soon
so when they borrowed all this stock
when it was like five dollars hoping to
go to four dollars
they said we'll pay you back in a month
or whatever you know in two weeks or a
month
and that time is coming due and they're
gonna have to buy back all the stock
they borrowed
at four dollars for a hundred and ninety
three dollars or three hundred dollars
and it's gonna bankrupt them it's gonna
be massively bad that's why they can't
just hold
in a perfect world they would just wait
they would just sit on their ass and
wait because eventually it's going back
to zero
this is not going to say it forever but
they can't wait that's why the timing is
so perfect
they have a very short window to pay
back all the bets they made
and they have to get it down quickly so
they're literally pulling every dirty
trick they can possibly do
because they have to get it down or
they're losing billions and losing
billions
is people will kill for that i mean
they'll do anything
what does it mean people give money to
hedge funds so let me explain what a
hedge fund is because i think a lot of
you just think it's a rich guy with
hedges
a hedge fund is that it is a rich guy
with hedges
but it's like this guy chris hedges
um yeah it's it's usually a rich guy or
a team of rich guys
that um other rich people give their
money to
so the hedge fund manager is usually
rich himself but he's not the only
person who's putting the money in
a hedge fund manager is like he goes
around to other rich people and he's
like hey give me your money
i'll invest it and make a good return
and then take a little cut
and instead of investing it wisely or
safely they invested it in
risky naked gamestop shorts
so now not only are they going to lose
their own personal money
they have lost all the other rituals
money who they took from
there was that rich guy crying on the
news
in one of the just most disgusting acts
of uh
lack of self-awareness just inhaling
billionaire level copium
the reason the market is doing what he's
doing is people are sitting at home
getting the checks from the government
okay and this fair share is a [ __ ]
concept
it's just a way of attacking wealthy
people and
you know i think it's inappropriate we
all got to work together and pull
together
the reason tomorrow we gotta work
together and pull together
to bankrupt game stops so i make
billions
what are you talking they're working
together and pointing together to attack
you
the problem is to hurt them we have to
hurt regular people
we have to hurt stupid people to hurt
rich people
some idiot has to buy gamestop stock at
350 dollars
vastly more than it's worth to help
drive it up
and they're probably gonna get stuck
losing all that money
it's a sacrifice there's no way
it's not gonna be a clean it's not gonna
be like all the poor people win and
their people lose
even if we get them it's gonna result in
a lot of people
who don't have the money getting hurt so
that's why i'm
i'm i'm uh ambivalent
what we don't talk about is that there's
there's other
smaller hedge funds that are
also jumping on board this money train
to try and squeeze the big guys
out of shorts and they're putting in
millions is it possible those hedge
funds losing all their money crashes the
market because they have to sell
everything to cover yes
so this is one of the scariest things
and i think i can't tell how much of it
is
real and how much of it is
fear-mongering by a well-paid pr machine
that is trying to convince people not to
invest in gamestop stock but
the the worry is that if you are a
multi-billion dollar hedge fund
who has billions and billions of dollars
invested in a lot of different things
let's say you have
a million shares of amazon a million
shares of apple a million shares of
tesla
and also you're shorting gamestop if you
start to lose
billions of dollars on gamestop you have
to pull out of your other stocks to
cover
because you need the money so you sell
your amazon you sell your tesla
which means amazon tests are going down
which means when people are like oh [ __ ]
amazon's going down i better sell which
means they sell more
which creates a loop where the entire
market can have a [ __ ] gigantic crash
because people meme gamestop one thing i
will say is elon's goofy ass dude
let me tell you something elon's not
i don't need elon musk to be like yeah
let's [ __ ] over the billionaires come on
comrades
elon you're the richest man on planet
earth [ __ ] you
okay i'm not a papa elon stan but
he's only doing it because elon musk
hates short sellers
because short sellers try to tank tesla
all the time
so now this has happened the rich guys
are gonna be a lot more careful
okay at least for a little while until
they get greedy again
you're not gonna see exposed open naked
shorts that people can find and meme
it's not gonna happen everyone is
drastically closing their positions
right now
if you're thinking oh man this was great
when's the next one
i would be careful because the next one
you hear about on wall street is going
to be like a scam
on wall street bets i mean people are so
hungry for more of this
they're going to jump on anything
they're jumping on dogecoin for christ's
sake
dogecoin is a literal ponzi scheme do
you think it's too late to get on gme
like i've said
it's a complete crap shoot nobody knows
what lengths they will go to they could
literally shut down trading tomorrow
what's the best time to sell well if you
buy tomorrow when it's spiking
there's this could go really high their
short positions don't
unwind they're not they're not all done
tomorrow
i think if you bought tomorrow and it
spikes like all day and ends up higher
you could hold a few more day i mean you
could hold i don't know i
want to we'll have to check it out
tomorrow but you could probably hold if
you buy tomorrow and it spikes i mean
there's a chance it goes [ __ ] rip
roaringly high
what do you think will happen to
canadian brokers i
i don't know they'll fall off their
moose
who knows why would that matter can it
what's different about canadian brokers
anyone else don't know what a dumb
question
what is hedging your bets hedging your
bets
is basically taking a bet that's the
opposite of what you made
like to put it super simply it's like if
you bet all on red and roulette
and then you're like oh [ __ ] i could
lose a lot of money i'm gonna bet some
on black
that way either way i'm fine
that i'm just trying to keep it as
simple as possible how did they sell
stock they didn't have
it's it's it's some financial tomfoolery
dude uh
again i'm an amateur i'm i'm a regular
person
i don't it's illegal the naked short
sell which is selling stock you don't
have so i don't know exactly how they
did it
but essentially like you want to buy
carrots from me
okay so i show you this one carrot and
i'm like yeah i'll sell you a bag of
carrots
for 10 bucks and you're like okay deal
we shake hands on it
and i'm like i'll deliver to you i'll
deliver to you in a week i'll deliver to
you
but you bought it i don't have the bag
of carrots i only have one carrot
but you bought it for ten dollars so i
can go to the store buy it for five and
come back to you
and as long as you never know i did that
the deal was fine okay it's fine
but if i say okay i'm gonna go to the
bag of carrots thanks for your 10 bucks
i'll get you the bad carrots and i go to
the market
and the carrots are 400
then i'm [ __ ]
and that's what's happening with
gamestop right now okay they said okay
let me borrow you they sold gamestop
stock they didn't have
and they were gonna go buy it back for
cheaper and they went to go buy it back
and it's
[ __ ] a thousand times more than it
was and so they're freaking
out as i would be if i owed somebody
all these carrots
why don't you believe in diamond hands
because of human psychology and because
not everybody is committed to the
mission
but all the people that heard about this
from their barber or
you know saw it on the news or heard
about it from a friend
or they're not diamond hands dude they
just bought it because i thought it was
going up and the second they see it goes
down they [ __ ]
diamond hands to explain it is the idea
that
once people start selling it creates a
panic and a snowball effect then it
starts going down to zero okay
once it goes down from somebody selling
more people sell okay and so everyone's
like hold
diamond hands diamond is the hardest
material hold on to your stock with
diamond hands never let it go
that's what diamond hands means hdr i
just realized you talked about unethical
wall street is for an hour while wearing
the [ __ ] enron hat
yes sir yes sir shout out to my boys at
enron dude
they've been doing since the beginning
these [ __ ] new school
billionaires they don't know they don't
have to defraud they can't defraud like
the boys at enron did it those guys
could commit a fraud dude
the things enron was doing make today
look like nothing
today was insanely unethical but enron
dude enron was like enron was every
single month
saying they made more money
telling wall street literally publishing
accounting reports
that were completely made up saying they
made more money driving their stock up
while literally losing money hand over
fit it was complete fraud
[Music]
you
I ranked every Super Bowl ad... - YouTube
okay marketing monday it's the super
bowl edition
i go a little bit bigger for these tom
brady's still
winning super bowls of 43. honestly what
the hell is going on
if you just count tom brady in his 40s
and he's 43
he has a hall of fame career that's
insane
i don't whatever soul he's sucking out
of his child's mouth
when he kisses him on it is working so i
don't know i had no much more to say
about that but it was the story this is
like the only interesting story of the
game itself
that's why thankfully we have me to talk
about the actual interesting things
the ads unfortunately i have some
unfortunate news for you
the ads were not that great this year
but through distinct
marketing analysis
i have analyzed and determined a special
rating algorithm
to determine which ads are amazing
stellar rise above the rest
revealing the atriac algorithm
this is a graphic in the shape of a
football
how cool is that that shows you how much
uh
30 seconds of super bowl air time has
cost over the past 10 years
the game had a football in it and this
is a football
they don't really make them like me all
right starting at 2010
uh it was about 3 million this year was
the highest
in recorded history nearly 6 million
so if you're in pretty solid or above
you probably got your money's worth
given how many people saw it but if
you're below
that's where it gets risky so we're
going to start off with a really
interesting ad the m ms ad
[Music]
i feel bad for kicking your seat on
purpose i'm sorry for mansplaining
that's when a man i know what it is i
promise i will not eat any more of your
friends
really okay it might happen one more
time
first of all fine fine ad i mean i think
up until
up until this point i'm really on board
it's kind of like slice of life stuff
and then you have this like
save the budget on the celebrity here
who is cannibalizing this
i mean this is like uh this is like a
captured child
uh the idea of using the product as like
a i'm sorry you know
this here sucks i'm sorry here's a m ms
it's pretty good i like how often the
product is featured
i'm putting it in pretty solid i think
that was actually pretty solid again
m ms are not real so i guess most people
don't share my concern for their
well-being
now this one's interesting the doritos
3d commercial
lately i just i haven't been feeling
quite like myself it's like i used to be
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
a lot of mixed opinions in the chat let
me give you my thoughts
this is a good ad look the intro you're
you're intrigued
he's flat what the [ __ ] going on now
this scene
is really seen brought home for me from
a marketing perspective
they showed it off well with a
satisfying crunch i i like this whole
scene a lot from a marketing pov i think
this brought it home
literally i think they know what they're
doing this is a solid
if not great ad did you know that norway
sells way more electric cars per capita
than the us
norway
well i won't stand for it with gm one
thing i want to say about this ad
the casting choice of will ferrell is
inspired
just try to imagine anyone else but will
ferrell and the ad drops
10 percentage points
aquafina's sorry to disturb you but
norway's beating us at evs
uh-huh meet me there in an hour
hey norway listen up you fish loving
this place if he had screamed [ __ ] at
the top of his lung
i had to put this in great if they had
the balls to say you fish loving [ __ ]
oh my god it would have broken the
internet it's good because
gm is finally flipping their stance from
uh burying their head in the sand about
electric vehicles
and finding a way to get the everyman
will ferro is the perfect casting choice
for to consider buying evs
and the whole thing works pretty well
it's a good little story so i think this
is pretty good
let's add this one so i'm gonna put in
i'm putting this in pretty good bud
light
legends the avengers parody we didn't
know we needed
it's missing
[Music]
host malone cedric all right bud light
legends
let's do this they reunited him holy
[ __ ]
bud knight and cedric the crossover of
my fan fiction
is this canon cause like i i i run a a
fan fiction webpage
is this i need to update it if this is
canon this is canon holy [ __ ]
this changes the entire [ __ ] expanded
universe this is crazy
damn bud knight strong
no i loved you man did bud knight die
alright let's get out of here [ __ ]
blood knight just died and you're
[ __ ] you're celebrating
i'm putting it slightly money bailey
yeah i don't know it didn't didn't feel
like a
much of a breakthrough oh okay this one
i got a lot to say about this one so
let's watch it this is the mountain dew
ad featuring
john cena
[Music]
be the first to count and tweet the
exact number of mountain dew major known
bottles showing this commercial and you
could win a million dollars i'm gonna
tell you why this that was good
they got an extremely likable spokesman
they put their brand
everywhere they realized everyone's kind
of struggling right now and needs money
they went bigger they did a million
dollars and they said you have to go on
social media
and share this and talk about this and
of course people aren't like oh my god i
love mountain dew
they're trying to enter this contest so
it's a clean
aesthetic it shows the new flavor it's
got john cena very likable
they spent the money wisely so i'm
putting it on top it's in my top
oh this one okay if the light saucers
start making lemonade
probably when 2020 handed us all those
lemons 20 20 was a lemon of a year
there's a lot of lemons well you know
what they say when life gives you a
little bit i know the thing mark
i'm gonna give my thoughts i thought
this ad had a lot of potential
and i was disappointed and i don't i
really don't know how to even phrase it
i gotta put this probably in mediocre
this guy what if the blood knight came
in and he goes i'll drink to that and
slices a lemon
i would have [ __ ] stood up and
clapped that would have been amazing
you guys have been wanting okay where's
the cringe you're giving somebody adds
decent ratings
where's the cringe atriac don't worry
we got scott's miracle grow come on
leslie crush your core
i don't crush it emma dad it's the red
one get it
the other one do you guys get it it's
like a certain character we can't
legally name from the office
he's still got it so text me now
good delivery martha does that [ __ ]
take 400 and you wanted to go home
travoltas don't be tickety talking on my
grass
you figured it out that's how you appeal
to the zoomers
dickheady talking on my grass damn
that's an s-tier ad
there's no flaws this is what this
category was created for
everyone in this commercial just needed
some squeeze dude
certain is better by rocket mortgage we
even afford this house
i'm pretty sure we can pretty sure
rocket mortgage you can be certain
not pretty sure i'm pretty sure you
could take batista down
you're on
[Applause]
okay i'm pretty sure this is trending
i'm pretty sure these hornets aren't the
murdering type
look certain let's go with certain good
choice
oh my god can you believe it holy moly
rocket mortgage came through big the
only ad this one was quite uh
quite contentious
[Music]
i think it's pretty good stanz hates it
stan's hating it
is more proof to me that i'm right
stan's hated hell or high water
stance hated [ __ ] parasite stands
hated stanz isn't like anything good
dude
what was the tweet let me see the tweet
the tweet could change things
we can't give you back those 30 seconds
but we can give you a free t-shirt let's
the world know where you're standing or
attempt to pronounce 2016
oh i oh no he's right it's cringe now
i'm going to stick with my gut and put
it pretty solid so this one's
interesting
because it depicts my chat 100 you go
through a phase where you think
everything
i wish one of these scenes he just
pulled out an ipad and watched an entire
dream video
and watched all of minecraft manhunt
start to finish
that would have been that would have
been off on guard dude
we make these and these and other stuff
to help your parents keep you comfy
so yeah again this is tough of me to
rape i i
i think if you are a parent or someone
who finds babies cute this is a pretty
good ad right
huggies i put it at the bottom of good
it's a great ad for condoms
[Laughter]
whoa funniest chat message of the day
uh toyota's big game ad this is supposed
to be the tearjerker
mrs long yes we've found a baby girl for
your adoption but
there's some things you need to know her
legs
will need to be amputated it might not
be easy but
it'll be amazing toyota proud partner of
team usa
this ad is the type of ad
this ad helps toyota [ __ ] all no one
remembers as a toyota ad
the toyota branding is in the bumper at
the end which our brains automatically
tune out
it doesn't make you think if i'm going
to buy a car i think no
more or less of toyota after watching
this i'm going to put it in preach
corporation preach
this is sad who are you i'm your fairy
god mayo
now here's the hellman's magic creamy
dreamy
amy schumer is not i i have no
particular opinion on amy
i don't give a [ __ ] i don't know why
some people's identity is wrapped up in
hating amy schumer
but i can tell you from a marketing pov
if i was picking a spokeswoman
i wouldn't go to amy schumer i feel like
you could get somebody from
and you would get less hate on social
media than if you got amy schumer
so i'm gonna put this
in c for cringe next one is turbo tax
double decks live
this entire ad is about how the tax
system is so complicated
it's complicated because of you you
are doing it and then telling us how you
can save us with your army of desk
experts
read the comments let me see the massive
plow differently beam because chick
traditionally trap
wait a minute
you might spend a little extra money for
some bonus fake comments and some bonus
fake views
and that to me looks like it may have
actually happened here this is a very
interesting situation
the ad was terrible let's move it down
to what the [ __ ]
are you gonna buy the car if i could
just go home and discuss things with my
wife
go to vroom.com buy a car and we'll
deliver it contact free
good 30 second ad right off the bat
hooks you in
the switch into the taglines good well
contained ad
my only point of contention it didn't do
a good job of
of slamming home this vroom brand name
this is going up
at the top and actually great this is a
great 30 second spot
gamers take fuzzy wuzzy 28.
me blaming losses on a laggy network
only one or
two you really gonna lie to samuel l
jackson while he's holding the sparkle
stick
this is y'all's moment hey stop blaming
it
is
this is 5g built right own from verizon
again obviously amazing casting sam
jackson makes a cringe ad into a good ad
he turned an ad that should be totally
cringe into one that's like in on the
joke
but it somehow all comes together and
it's like you can like it ironically and
you could like it
unironically and you're both can be
right
read it dude if you know you know reddit
was five seconds long all we're not
going to stop it we're not going to
pause it
in the heartland wow great ad [ __ ]
fantastic thank you reddit i think this
ad
thought it had a good idea much like a
real redditor
it thought it had something really
special but it actually was a
boring repost so the reddit ad
goes i actually think it's what the [ __ ]
i think it's a big waste
jimmy john's now by the way if you guys
don't know my history with jimmy john's
i played league of legends in college 12
hours a day and i would eat one meal a
day a single jimmy john sandwich
so i have an affinity for the brand
aloha
tony bolognovich here the sandwich
business has been
real good to me but now i got this
jimmy's john
showing up on my turf telling me that
they got the sandwich
of all sandwiches but i got loyalty
stevie
you're dead to me this is war sandwich
war
i want to jbj sandwich right now god i
just take me back dude
let me just go back and just break down
my bottom lane
just insult every factor of their being
while macking on a jimmy john's sandwich
all i want to do is say hey caitlin you
ever played this [ __ ] game in your
[ __ ] life you
idiot for sure solidad let's put it up
in pretty solid
hey everyone welcome to waynesboro party
on wayne
as a local access show we want everyone
to support local restaurants
but we'd never manipulate you the way
all these other commercials do
right cardi b yeah eat
[Music]
locally
there's a lot of things wrong with this
whenever you put them in the exact same
costumes and set as they were when they
were like 26
imagine we flash forward 25 years
and ludwig's ludwig's wearing the
[ __ ]
maid costume or something and saying
mogul moves
it's just like it's so sad it's sad to
just go back to the past
to try and make a quick buck and the
takeaway is not that i want to eat local
with ubereats i mean the food never even
shows up dude
i really could put it anywhere but i'm
gonna put it in celebs need money
because that
is the core reason why mike myers would
become wayne again uh okay all right now
time for an ad that i think has been
did you see people have been interested
in did you steal my cheetos again
just tell them it was you but i cut you
at the counter
it wasn't me it wasn't me
okay well that's the first time that's
ever worked
i have so much to say you could re-cut
this fill this
trailer as a horror film because what
the [ __ ] is up
with their relationship that she has to
lie about eating cheetos
and then how stupid is ashton
or how stupid does mila think she
he is because the cheetahs are not
hidden at no point does she even hide
them
i feel like the subtext here is that
they hate each other and there's like a
real
anger brewing a real tension it celebs
need money badly this is what it is
this one needs to be watched and that of
course
is amazon it's just flawless
i mean i literally couldn't imagine a
more beautiful vessel for alexa to be
inside there on the sprinklers
honey i already ran the sprinklers
things are getting way too wet around
here
alexa
[Music]
amazon why are you so horny
to me when i made the what the [ __ ]
category
this was the ad for it i i don't know
why it's so
horny you don't really i mean this is
not something alexa can actually
do so i'm putting it in what the [ __ ]
bass pro shops
to everyone in our great outdoor family
in these trying times
we need nature more than ever we need
nature to help us heal
and reconnect with the ones we love the
most
what i like about this ad is two things
number one
i was really worried that nobody had
said trying times yet in that
i was like does anyone notice does he
corporation care
these times are so trying thank god for
bass pro shops
secondly uh the ads actually a great job
at their their main benefit i mean
i think this ahead does a good job of
making you want to do some nature stuff
it's a nice break from all the other ads
a little bit slower pace a little bit
more serene
this is a good ad i think this is really
solid i'm gonna put it in solid
number nine on youtube trending jeep

I Read Jeff Bezos's Book So You Don't Have To - YouTube
welcome to marketing monday
jeff bezos edition also titled
i read jeff bezos's book so you don't
have to
there's a couple nuggets of wisdom in
here that i think are actually kind of
helpful
to real people in their real lives and
then there's some stuff i want to make
fun of
so i got it all it's not just about
marketing today it's also about all of
business
and life advice and all you know all
that so if you're watching this
on youtube it is my personal mission and
dream to hit a hundred thousand
subscribers on youtube
by april and i'm about
14 000 away if you could find it in your
heart
and hit that button and turn it from
red to gray it would really mean a lot
to me
i read jeff bezos's book
so you don't have to a marketing monday
topic
by atriox jeff
bezos a man who went from this
famously i sell books to now i sell
whatever the [ __ ]
i want richest man in the world i think
he recently re-passed elon musk
what are his secrets and how did he fit
them all
in this i don't know 200-page book most
of its workout tips
most of this book is how to properly
maintain a bald head
and get the biceps bigger uh i want this
to be
uh known up front there are a lot of
things about jeff bezos and his colossal
dragon hoarding amount of wealth that i
do not support
so if i highlight a few things that i
think he's done right or has good ideas
on
that should not be considered a reigning
endorsement of amazon's business
practices
nor of the fact that a person should
have 150 billion dollars
okay i just want that to be clear right
the bat he's actually
quite a good writer especially the first
half of this book
is all letters to shareholders they
basically found every letter he ever
sent to amazon shareholders where he was
convincing them to give him money
basically for the business
and i found that he's a pretty good
writer and so i think
that made me more likely to trust some
of the things he's saying
and some of the ideas he has in contrast
to some other billionaires out there who
maybe aren't as eloquent
in their writing capabilities okay
maybe they're maybe they're a little
more direct you know they're not
[Laughter]
the way i structured this is i pulled
out like i think three things that i
think are actual lessons that i might
use
and i figure if i might use them in my
real life you might find benefit in
using them in yours okay
first ones think long term thing i was
impressed with with
uh his book and his writings from all
the way back to 1997
was how much he emphasized thinking
about the long term
so in 1997 he called his shared letter
it's all about the long term
okay in 99 he called it building for the
long term
in 2000 he called it taking the long
view and in 2003 he called it long-term
thinking okay so he's kind of terrible
at titling things
it kind of paid off so let me talk about
this so this is jeff bezos this is an
actual photo of jeff bezos age 30
in the first amazon office attempting to
become a twitch streamer but he was a
zero viewer andy
he just couldn't get the uh the primes
as it turned out
but from a long-term point of view
focusing more on the business than on
this
he ended up buying twitch instead and
basically planting his balls across
seattle
it's the most gaudy headquarters i've
ever seen in my life like a super
villain
so something about long-term paid off
i'm going to show you another uh thing
that sort of explains then i'll get to
the actual serious part
this is amazon stock price over the
years
you might notice from when it was
founded in 97
to basically about 2007 it didn't even
really go up at all
people might think this is all jeff
bezos is doing
jeff bezos and his intelligent planning
is the reason this all started to spike
i'd like to point something out to you
though this is whenever jeff bezos is
running the company
flat flat flat barely anything flat
a truck h truck joins amazon in 2014.
interesting maybe i had some good ideas
i just um little zoomer hdrock joined
in 2014 i don't know is that
i i'm just i'm just stating facts okay
you draw your own conclusions
just weird that like most of this seemed
to happen after i joined and started
shaking things up you know if you are
too focused on short-term metrics like
for example
even it's something as simple as as your
elo like if you're trying to gain
chest rating or get a better rank in
league of legends or valorenter
if you're too focused on short-term
metrics and numbers
you you become very fixed on what you
know works already
okay you get very much locked in on like
i only know how to play this champion or
i only know how to do
this one opening in chess if you give
yourself a more long-term view and say
okay eventually i'm gonna get this to
work
let me figure out the good habits that
make me make that possible
you're much more likely to experiment
find out what actually works
change find something maybe other people
aren't doing okay i want to do a quick
intermission here
because i was like wow jeff bezos you
included everything you ever wrote
except for those texts you sent
to uh this woman here to cheat on your
wife with and i thought well we should
probably include that
because you know how to spit game i love
you alive girl
i will show you with my body and my lips
and my eyes
very soon the trick is to be very
ominous and robotic
that's how you spit game like jeffy b
okay this is a real text that he sent
this woman
this you might think it's photoshop this
is also a real photo
jeff bezos uses billions of dollars to
get a cameo on star trek his favorite
show growing up
they said he showed up with more
security than the president
he was in like an suv with like nine
cars in front of him in the back and
full of bodyguards
[Laughter]
one other story from this series of
photos that i want to tell you
is you might be thinking who's the man
in this photo
this is patrick whitsell uh he
is the owner of wme one of the biggest
talent agencies
in hollywood and it's this woman's
husband
and you gotta think i i feel bad for
this guy
no these are all true no this is
everything i'm saying is not a joke by
the way
this is all everything on this slide is
true uh
because i can't imagine thinking you've
won
capitalism more than looking like this
this guy's probably like in his 50s
looks pretty good tall starts a talent
agency
makes it one of the biggest in hollywood
gets he's worth hundreds of millions of
dollars
and then jeff bezos comes along and
cucks him
if this guy can't win capitalism what
the [ __ ] hope do any of us have dude
this is a weird segue because the next
piece of advice
is probably the most important thing not
a joke in this whole presentation
uh and it's called the flywheel it's the
most important thing from badges amazon
i've actually used my real life
it's the it's the flywheel uh jetpacks
won't shut up about it it's very very
important to him
and when i started thinking about terms
of the flywheel i actually found it to
be extremely helpful
there's amazon's flywheel which is
boring okay
but the general idea is it's like a
wheel where
everything on the wheel makes the next
thing easier
and it should loop back to the original
thing that's the idea
i think like this all the time for a lot
of things and i'm going to show you two
examples that i use in my real life
of an actual flywheel so the first one
is one that i'm constantly struggling
with
and that is to sleep on time to work out
and sleep on time
and so a flywheel that i use this works
negatively and positively
is if i work out during the day if i
work out during the day i am
much more likely to fall asleep on time
and get good sleep
and if i get good sleep then i can
actually have the energy to work out the
next day now if you [ __ ] up any part of
this let's say for example i stay up
really late
then i wake up feeling groggy and [ __ ]
and i don't want to work out
and if i don't work out then i stay up
really late again and
the cycle perpetuates it's bad okay so i
think about this flywheel and if i get
it started
the most important thing about a
flywheel i don't talk about this too i
don't have a quote here but
in the book and in what i learned about
it jeff bezos talks so much about how
like
the hardest part of flywheel is starting
it you have to like you have to
manually push it basically he talks
about you're grinding the flywheel to
get started
it doesn't want to move no part of this
is easy
you start it and then once it starts it
picks up speed this is an example for my
stream
if you make a funny twitch segment it's
usually better when you have
a chat for example this is when i
invited my family on to twitch
okay and we had chat members come in and
ask them questions
that's funnier because i have more of a
chat okay funky segments
then you can pay editors to turn those
into youtube videos okay
people see the youtube videos and they
join the chat or create more reddit
posts
and then i get more funny twitch
segments and you
circle it and then each each step gets
easier and you make more money from each
one and it grows
i mean in my early streams i had like 80
to 100 viewers i had nobody
not a lot of people in here and you have
to sort of make it work and then i had
to take a loss on editing
so i would pay editors out of money out
of my real job i basically had to take
money from my real life i had to lose
money on twitch
i lost money for the first six months i
think
uh now it's about breakeven probably
less with taxes but why would you pay
taxes
because i'll go to jail have to grind
this wheel to get it started but once it
gets started
it's actually it starts spinning and now
i mean i took
i took some days off i took what 10 days
off and this content almost ran by
itself with the power of
the the team that i built with with uh
the editors
and uh the content we've already done in
the past all right there was still new
stuff that read it
so that's the sort of idea people g i
make your wheel spin oh yeah yeah
i mean chat does chat literally chat
makes this the segment's funnier
if i yoink a jet a joke from chat this
one's pretty good too
actually just because people i think get
too stressed this one's called focus on
big decisions
now i picked these three this is not
from i picked these four actually these
are not from the book
but he talked about big business this is
the type of big life decision so things
like where you work
where you live who you marry and who you
prime to on twitch
okay you should focus only on a few big
things to stress about
but the general idea is that most
decisions in life
are what he calls two-way doors and what
that means is
you can go back okay so stop stressing
so much about it
a business example uses like all right
let's say we make a big decision decide
amazon's going to go into health care
okay what the logo looks like or
you know uh what the exact pricing is
gonna be or
all of those things you can change later
i'm gonna talk about some bad things i
found in this book
but i'm gonna tell you the last good
thing i found and this is another thing
that i use
in my life generally uh and his concept
of strategy
as doing hard things i have been in a
meeting i remember when i was 22 or 23
i was in a meeting at twitch and i was
supposed to present the deck on my
strategy
for something i think it was promoting
twitchcon the first twitchcon
and this woman in the meeting
like laughed at one of my slides and
said that's not a strategy
that's a tactic and i felt crushed
and i i like stressed about it and i was
like what
what's the difference between strategy
and tactics and like tried to learn
try to learn all about like fancy
definitions of strategy
okay one thing that has been very clear
in my mind and a good way to think about
how to be strategic in your life is what
is something
hard i can do that most other people
won't
now the famous amazon example is this if
you are running a business
and someone in the meeting is like hey
let's do
same-day delivery nationwide
most businesses would say no that's
way too expensive and it really is
the i mean the logistical challenges are
crazy how how the [ __ ] are we gonna do
that
no you're fired that's stupid as hell
but the unique thing about amazon's
culture is they're like okay wait a
minute
but if we do it who can copy us you need
to be a [ __ ] multi-gazillion dollar
company
no one else can do it it creates sort of
a moat they call it
so that's the idea is you do hard things
that less people can do
and you start to build this moat that
eventually no one else can do what you
can do
i think the way to think about it in
real life is you find a goal what's
something really hard let's say you want
to be a great editor or for example i
think uh
nick was in here earlier wanted to get
better at editing and he made a
challenge to make like a new combo video
every day and he became really [ __ ]
get an amazing combo video this summer
it's like the idea is that you're
picking something hard
something challenging that you think
most other people that have your goal
won't do let's say you follow all my
steps so far
you're a billionaire on your way to a
trillionaire there's one more thing you
gotta do
okay and it's really important fill the
last half of your book with
puff pieces let me give you an example
of one story that really stood out to me
by the way i think this is a true story
but it's so funny that he chose to
include it i lost the page too this is
jeff bezos talking about his childhood
nine years old
jeff bezos young jeff bezos saw a
commercial on tv
talking about how smoking is bad for you
and how each puff of a cigarette takes
two minutes off your life
now jeff bezos as you might expect was a
little nerd
he liked math okay he liked doing
calculations
and his grandma smoked so he's in the
car
with his grandmother and he's like oh
i've got a plan
that'll make her think i'm a clever
little boy
he counted the number of puffs of her
cigarette
in one day and then the next day
he did the math and he he poked his head
in the front of the car
tapped his grandmother on the shoulder
and proudly proclaimed at two minutes
per puff
you've taken nine years off your life
and he says he has a vivid memory of
thinking
he was going to be applauded for his
cleverness
and arithmetic skills he thought she
would say
jeff you're so smart you've made some
tricky estimates
and done some great division instead his
grandmother burst into tears
this is a real story that he remembers
and he said the lesson from that
and i think this is the right lesson i'm
just not sure that jeff bezos really
took
it his grandfather told him jeff one day
you'll understand
that it's harder to be kind than to be
clever
now jeff bezos likes doing hard things i
don't think he ever decided to do that
the last thing i have here is his piece
of advice to aggressively stop
unions and treat your workers pretty
terribly
here is an ad that ran on twitch
tell recently when it was shut down
after public outcry we really
don't need anyone coming in
and telling us what they want to give us
because basically
we have everything we need here who
wants to pay those dues to the union
gross and that's why jeff bezos does the
hard thing himself
okay somebody has to wake up early
and stand off camera with a gun pointed
at this woman
to get her to say these lines like
amazon is great and to get
slightly personal here which i don't
usually
want to do on stream my father
who works 30 years in the military
he's one of the hardest workers i know
worked his ass off for 30 years
i called him yesterday he has worked
at an amazon warehouse as a warehouse
manager
for like six months and he is more
tired than i've ever seen
in my entire life and it made me a
little bummed
okay i have never seen my dad that tired
he is exhausted
and i know how hard he works and so
i want you to personally know that while
i think that jeff bez is actually a very
intelligent guy
a very smart guy i don't think he's
optimized all of his uh
newfound wealth from a very smart bet on
the internet
for good just yet that's the end your
next stop now though
assuming you have uh less morals than me
is trillionaire status you have
everything you need

The Worst Brand Tweets Ever - YouTube
welcome to marketing monday's silence
brand edition where we're talking about
all of the stupidest social media posts
in brand history okay so
i originally was gonna talk about some
of the saddest
commercials of all time today
tearjerkers but burger king had other
plans
this morning burking uk as you may have
heard
women belong in the kitchen full stop
end of tweet 150 000 retweets
they followed it with significantly less
retweets they
followed it by saying if they want to of
course
that's why we're launching a new gender
equality
in cooking scholarship now those tweets
got
you know a few million impressions few
thousand likes
this tweet got a hundred million plus
impressions 150
000 retweets and like all of the
alt-right
rallying behind it so i'm not so sure it
worked
out exactly as they wanted on
international women's day
but the core problem that i see
in this that i see in a lot of marketing
is an attempt to be
way too [ __ ] clever it's like an idea
that you think is cool in a boardroom
oh this is so [ __ ] clever dude we'll
hit them with the women belong in the
kitchen
and then twist it we'll subvert it and
then the idea is that it hits the
internet
and then you've given the internet this
screenshot if you're like
you weigh 118 pounds soaking wet
and there's a school bully and you're
like i'm gonna study judo and
uh naruto run and the bully's picking on
you like all right here we go
and then he just [ __ ] decks you
because he weighs 100 pounds more and
he's twice as big
that's what the internet is the internet
is the bully and you are trying to do
some kind of wordplay creative it
doesn't work
the second thing is that there's some
people saying well all press
is good press and obviously that is not
true
people already knew what bird king was
bird king is a big
multinational brand you want to either
stay level
or increase your brand perception this
is terrible
people took this opportunity just to
[ __ ] on burger king's food by the way
uh then of course they uh followed it up
with this
kfc gaming followed up by saying the
best time to leak this post was
immediately after posting it the second
best time is now
and burger king responded by saying they
double down they said
why would we delete a tweet that's
drawing attention three hours later the
tweet was deleted
i was waiting today i had a clock dude i
knew this second the suite went up it's
a matter of time
it's literally like jack bauer24 this
tweet will be deleted within the day i
know it
because the second the new story gets
big enough that an executive at burger
king hears about it
they get scared boom it's over shut it
down you get the call dude
unfortunately you can't really delete
all of the print
ads you made for your clever campaign
that are now
rolled out in magazines across the
country
i cannot believe they got this approved
it's just this is the worst part of it
though is like once something's out on
social it's like property of the public
so you really have to
you have to err sometimes on being a
little duller
because if you get too risque
or flamboyant the first reaction is
often
the permanent reaction all right so this
is again comes from i think a deep lack
of understanding of how social works
how sort of the group think of it works
and how the immediate
nature of it works so now i'm gonna go
in i think we covered burger king's
tweet i
i i don't know what to tell you i will
say so there was also the um
there was two terrible tweets this week
from brands the second one
was the tsm tweet it was it was making
fun of suicide super yikes terrible
tweet
i obviously think the tweet is obviously
terrible you should delete it
but i felt bad because uh the guy posted
a tearful heartfelt apology immediately
deleted it immediately
said he just didn't know he thought the
guy was walking away people were calling
for him to be fired
i my general thought is that this is
different from the bk tweet
the bk guys doubled down thought they
were being clever
and uh and deserved to be all the mocked
i think this one should just be deleted
and moved on that's my opinion you can
have your own
i just really doubt that the person that
posted this and he's a young guy was
like yeah
i think i'm gonna make fun of suicide
that's my thought that's my take
but that means it's a very hot week for
talking about brand fails
around i would say 2012
2013 was the launch of denny's
tumblr denny's tumblr was just basically
an offshoot project
by one woman who worked at denny's and
wasn't being monitored that closely
once people saw that was successful all
hell broke loose
but that began an era of brand social
but as the years have gone on and we've
all gotten a little more used to social
and every brand has tried to do it we've
gotten a little more jaded we've gotten
a little bit more like wow
this is super cringe and you're just
trying to sell me stuff and so
i'm gonna go through a lot of the ways
that i see brands [ __ ] up on social
because again mostly with social it's an
act to try and not
[ __ ] up so here's what you want to do to
not [ __ ] up
step one is they don't know what the
hashtag is
before they post so here's an example
of digiorno's pizza using the why i
stayed
which is about domestic abuse saying you
had pizza
who's not guilty about eating all the
tasty treats they want
casey anthony was not guilty that's what
was trending when you use this
these are examples of social media
managers not
taking a look at what the hashtag is for
sometimes they know what it's about and
they don't care
like in the example here kenneth cole
here
fashion brand did know what hashtag
cairo was about
i think the arab spring riots rumor is
they heard our new spring collection is
now available online
god damn they [ __ ] knew and they
thought this is a good ass tweet
but uh the most common that i've seen
from social media
managers and teams is forgetting they're
still
logged into the brand account and
thinking they're on their personal
account
stubhub tweeted thank [ __ ] it's friday
can't wait to get out of this stub
sucking hell hole
he works at stubhub
[Laughter]
so again before you tweet something
really uh
political controversial just make sure
whose account you're on it's really easy
this has happened to me at twitch so i
was on my phone and it's really hard to
tell unless you check the little tiny
icon
if i'm on the hrac account or i'm on the
twitch account thankfully
this is what a [ __ ] virgin i was i
was so obsessed with twitch
and watching esports that my real
account and the twitch account were
almost
indistinguishable so i would tweet like
oh melee turn about to go live
and that's like basically what we would
tweet on twitch
there was no difference that's it's the
sad thing
as i forgot what i was on and it didn't
matter
most brand fails because those are the
most common ones that i've seen
the less common ones are when brands try
to be
funny because generally the first lens
we look at
when we see a post is who it came from
you can see
the exact same post from two different
people will get different amounts of uh
engagement even if they both have no
followers an example tweet here
that would be funny or relatable from
maybe like
basic white girl account but not funny
from chase bank a multi-billion dollar
bank is this one
why is my balance so low bank account
make coffee at home
bank account eat food you already have
in the fridge bank account you don't
need a cab with 23 blocks
i guess we'll never know i mean it's not
a great tweet but the idea is like okay
that would be fine if it wasn't from
chase [ __ ] bank
a bank that basically milks people with
absurdly disguised fees
obviously from chase bank this [ __ ]
isn't fun okay you just can't you can't
break that
doesn't matter how funny it is they have
to know it it's got to be funny coming
from you
an all-time classic of bad brand twitter
is
holidays most specifically as a marketer
that loves seeing
terrible brand tweets i look forward to
seeing the one or two brands
every year that think they can make a
911 post work
because it never seems to dry up we have
build a bear [ __ ] workshop
putting a bear in camo and tweeting we
will never forget
cvs pharmacy you know try to keep it as
basic as possible
but they thought we gotta add the cvs
logo here
hold don't post that wait
just quickly make sure we add the logo
to that image we don't want people
ripping that off from us
i guess my one piece of advice to social
media managers out there
would be you don't need a 911 post ever
it's super simple this one i i need a
i need a better it's a tough one to
explain
you know it was just 2013 so it's early
days of social
so here's what happened originally a
pastor
came into an applebee's and instead of
tipping his waitress after a meal he had
a pretty large group
he wrote i only tip god 10 why would i
tip you 15.
now that waitress understandably was a
little bit pissed
she took a picture of it and tweeted it
and people
they started roasting this guy and then
in response applebee's
fired the server so right in the middle
of
everyone roasting this guy appleby said
let's get involved and make them hate us
more now obviously
people got really upset so they doubled
down
they wrote [ __ ] novels about how hey
look they have
guidelines and like you cannot show
anything that gives away a customer's
name
except the internet undefeated found
like a post from a few days ago
where you posted a nice message with a
customer's name
awesome job mike henning so the lesson
sort of from this one
everything you've ever done the internet
will find there are no secrets
so don't lie uh this is one that i've uh
noticed happen again and again never
ever ever
do anything at all that involves
ai or fan submissions
ever because you get this i had to
censor these
because they're [ __ ] disgusting but
an example is that
these are ai cr i'm sorry fans submitted
adidas jerseys
that say terrible things about the
holocaust
racist [ __ ] and these are all coming
from adidas's account
so literally it's the it's the [ __ ]
adidas account
tweeting user generated [ __ ] things
over and over
terrible so what you want to do is not
do
auto-generated ai [ __ ] it never works
never
we've talked about examples before just
don't do it
it never works now the final thing i
want to talk about in my presentation
was about the recent trend has been to
be
really really personified to try and
seem like you're as relatable
you know just what up fellow kids the
prime example of that
is sunny d tweeting i can't do this
anymore
to sell [ __ ] orange sugar water dude
this to me one of the worst brand tweets
of all time
this was this did take place at the end
of a super bowl live tweet
but the way they responded
did not lean into that pop-tart said hey
sonny
can i please offer you a hug we're gonna
get to this together my friend
by the way one thing i [ __ ] hate
about
any brand tweet that gets replies or
responses or retweets
is that every other brand goes oh [ __ ]
this is our shot
but sunny d did themselves no favors
with the super bowl story
by responding to moon pie what's going
on sunny
mood last night all good mp thanks for
checking in
i love you [ __ ] off you're not real
people
i hate to be that guy however these
twitter accounts have no other purpose
in the seller's products they're using
depression
to sell you a product which is to put it
lightly pretty irresponsible this guy's
nicer than i was
because at the time i said brands
feigning suicidal thoughts to more
relatably sell sugary only products is
pretty dystopian
but that guy's a little more uh nice
than i was so if you are a brand
you need to recognize that we're all
aware that you're an employee
this is all a scheme to make money at
the end of the day you only exist to
sell more of a product
and we understand that and the more
clearly you understand that
i think the better your social can be
people are not opposed
to brands on principle if you are aware
and honest that you're trying to sell
something
people are generally either ignore it or
they're receptive
it's only when you get slimy with it
that people
really start to get angry that was the
end of my presentation
and i thought those were all pretty
funny but i want to take a look at some
of yours
is this this was an email this is
unfortunate because you have to schedule
these emails well ahead
to get everything ready but congrats you
survived the boston marathon
after the explosion that they sent to
every adidas person that went
is insane i just i've one of the first
jobs i had at twitch
was managing the email as before i
worked when i worked on social
it's a miserable thankless job corporate
emails are the worst
so it's a miserable job i remember uh
this is a true story uh if bennett's w
is in my chat he'll tell you
i once was working late on one of these
emails
and i had to write the emails too i had
to write them get them approved by like
all these different teams and then
set up descending it was it was really
terrible it was not a fun job
and i was tired and i was putting this
together and i remember
you have to make the email subject
header before you write it
and it's like on a separate page in
mailchimp and so like i didn't know what
i was writing about yet so i just put
sdfg like i literally just spammed my
keyboard
and then i wrote the whole tweet and
then it was late did he put the image
here earlier wait
he has the image you [ __ ] you kept
this
and we sent eight million people just
the message that said fcfg
yeah he worked at twitch in [ __ ]
three years and he kept his [ __ ]
tweet
[ __ ] you ben anyway yeah i sent this
tweet to eight million people thank god
they didn't just [ __ ] fire me it was
like one this is early on too
i had to write about league of legends
world i mean it was a pain
you have that email in your inbox that's
so funny
[Laughter]
it really was just a terrible experience
that being said this was my fault
sdfg in history dude never forget

The Saddest Ads of All Time - YouTube
welcome to marketing monday saddest
ads of all time edition try
not to cry today we're gonna be watching
the saddest ads
the entire marketing industrial complex
can throw at us
when people tell me oh advertising
doesn't work on me okay i don't buy
things
you might think i would tell you
actually you're wrong as a marketer no
you're wrong
but really you're mostly right but ads
that are emotional
much more likely they'll become
remembered and get your brand their
brand entrenched in your brain
but i would say in 2011 there was an
ad by google and with this ad by google
it kicked off a new trend of s
advertisements
i'm gonna be referring to them as sads
from now on to save time
that have started to rise in the past
basically nine ten years
every year because we see two million
ads a year
they have to get more that to crank up
the emotion
consistently so we're in for a hell of a
run of sad ads today
now i want to kick off with this google
ad this google ad
is in my mind the one that kicked off
the trend
google's ad dear sophie
[Music]
that ad tested off the charts i mean
people really
felt a connection to it it wasn't too
obtrusive about
using their products and uh it's it's a
good ad i mean it's it's a good way of
using emotion and
tying your products uses to things in
the real world but because it was good
it inspired imitators
now there's a lot of ways this can be
used i think this this way we saw here
is a little bit sweeter
one of the ways i've seen use that i
find a little more distasteful is an ad
i saw from subaru
if you guys know what it is or maybe you
can find it basically it's about a child
getting into a car crash and the mom
receiving the phone call
and the mom is like not sure if the kid
is dead or not
and then they find out that the kid is
okay only because of the subaru's
best-in-class safety features
and i was like damn that is you really
took it to that next level huh
that's emotionally manipulative and they
played that ad everywhere it probably
was effective right
this one is called silence of love and
this is not even an english commercial
this is a thai commercial with english
subtitles
but it has 9 million views so i
guarantee it's a sad one brace yourself
by
[Music]
so
[Music]
what what
[Applause]
[Music]
oh my god that's that is
so over the top jesus christ
that's really really emotionally if that
had been like a documentary
i would have said powerful but to sell
life insurance
that's low man the father's love
with a disability suicide all in one
dude they crammed it all in one
well we started off with a bang let's
see where he goes from here
how about imagine
does this really require all of us come
on mom asked us to do this
[Music]
hey that's my marble
[Music]
guys what is that
[Music]
no shot no
shot
[Music]
the moral is to dig up your dead parrots
and hope they had pirates gold and a
powerball ticket
is that the lesson go dig up grandma's
grave
she might have had [ __ ] cortez's gold
doubloons
what an insane commercial a little bit
a little bit twisted but remarkably but
also just silly i mean a silly concept
what makes it so silly is the gold this
bag of [ __ ] gold bullion dude
i can't imagine grandma winning the
powerball is just buying
[ __ ] fort knox gold dude see it on
facebook all right we're gonna watch
ari's ad now
this is ahri's submission for sad ads so
i've mentioned this before so there's an
art to using
puppies and dogs in advertisements okay
it's an easy
life hack if you're a marketer because
we love dogs there's an art to it and
the advertising brand that has figured
it out the art the most is budweiser
this appears to be one of them welcome
home buddy
you and me we were made for love
[Music]
i'll be waiting here
[Music]
i'll see you later buddy
[Music]
poor dog no
i'm sorry i'm back i'm back
to me yeah i'm back a classless ad would
have ended here
okay a little bit more shocking but they
saved it they brought it home
they wrote it to the edge and they
brought it back if i'm being honest
arya's used this ad in our regular lives
not for drinking and driving but for
just driving safe like i'm never going
too fast
she reminds me of this ad it's like wow
i don't want my dog who i love my dog
like it actually works so uh good good
ad
somebody said if thai insurance made
this ad the dog would have hung
itself probably true because they really
really really don't know when to stop
and the car would have crashed
and then like when the family came over
to inspect the remains
the [ __ ] morgue would have blown up
dude and they would have been like tie
insurance
we have fire insurance too that's what
they would have done
now holidays are big in emotional ads we
all get extra emotional around holidays
there's gonna be some christmas ads
today i'm gonna start with this one okay
an emotional christmas ad that will move
you to tears
[Music]
hmm
let's go let's go
[Music]
the drip iced out head to toe
pure sigma energy dude wow
[Music]
let's go crush it
[Music]
laughs
[Applause]
very sweet that was sweet that was a
sweet ad
old man gets shredded lift up his
daughter good i mean
i actually don't know what doc morris is
but i assume if it's just healthcare
that's pretty fair if they sold
tracksuits it'd be an easy a
if they sold whatever he was wearing
that would be the best out of all time
because i'm gonna cop this
immediately following this stream yeah i
mean in general a heartwarming ad
that makes you cry to me i'll always
prefer
to an ad that tries to make you cry by
shock value because here's the deal
an ad is at most a minute long right a
minute minute 30.
so if they're gonna make you care about
something enough to cry when it dies
they have to use a lot of cheap
shortcuts in general i feel that's
exploitative johnny walker called dear
brother
an alcohol out let's see what they got
walk the roads of our youth
through the land of our childhood our
home and our truth
we were wondrous never lost
our ways were always the same
and if your heart's full of sorrow keep
walking
never oh no
i will always be alive oh no by your
side
in your mind sad it was a ghost
i don't like it especially for an
alcohol brand alcohol praise on
depression
you know what's funny is like if it's
just two brothers sharing a drink
like up to here it's still a good ad
right i thought it was strong
i mean i i already liked it because like
i couldn't imagine me and my i love my
brother but there's no shot me my
brother are like
goofing around walking along you know a
[ __ ] wilderness
my brother would be like what the [ __ ]
are we doing out here why
what are we what is going on why are you
trying to like bat my hair
no i don't want any johnny walker it's
three in the afternoon
it's a tuesday brandon that's that's
what would happen for me so i was like
wow this is a sweet commercial
let's go no guys it doesn't matter what
side you're on
here just watch something or play a game
daddy

haha girls just happy what is this
[Music]
[Music]
wow absolutely brilliant
thank you geez louise they're going all
in today
they're going all in today apple huh
the thing that put that ad over the top
for me
was the acting of the old man he went
for the [ __ ] oscar
why did he have to sound so insanely
sad and proud it's an apple ad dude they
paid you a little bit of money just
he was trying to win award in my
experience
kids locked away from a family event on
an ipad
do not create beautiful reminiscing
looks at the family's past
they just play temple run let's see what
we got here another thai commercial i
don't even know if i'm ready dude
i'm not ready for another thai
commercial i'm not ready for something
as sad as a thai commercial
this one's called my dad is a liar daddy

in the world
he is my superman very sweet so far
daddy is just great but
he lies
[Music]

insurance in thailand
god they go [ __ ] so hard lord
okay well yeah i wasn't i wasn't
expecting man literally i was like
cracking a joke for the first 30 seconds

different reasons
hungrybox is in need of a major comeback
i got you son
your moves were a little bit offsun you
must be hungry
fuel up on campus chunky soup wow
now that's heartwarming it's sad because
he was disqualified immediately for
mid-set

i just think it's so
[ __ ] funny how about nationwide's boy
speaking of insurance nationwide boy
commercial let's see an american
insurance company compared to a taiwan
how do they handle it it's called boy
i'll never learn to ride a bike
i'll never learn to fly or travel the
world with my best friend
dog i couldn't grow up because i died
from an accident jesus christ
we believe in tide pods what a
[ __ ] heel turn you know at least the
thai commercials have the decency to pay
for three minutes of ad space
so they have time to build some sort of
story they're too far
you obviously only wanted to spend the
minimum so you bought about 40 seconds
and then you're like [ __ ] we already
spent the first 30 getting another kid
we have five seconds to twist it because
i died from an accident
that's that's the line holy moly
uh that wasn't wholesome at all and that
was pretty terrible honestly
fighting bad ad honestly a bad super
bowl ad bad big waste of money
i don't this one says the irish road
safety ad is so
horrifying it's banned on tv before
9 00 pm this one i'm gonna have to give
a trigger warning
okay we're gonna watch it obviously but
it might be really sad so don't watch it
unless you want to
she's got a smile that it seems to me
reminds me of childhood
memories
i'm gonna make you guys cry from the
beautiful singing like maybe i'll just
sing the rest
fresh as a bright blue sky
[Music]
whoa
what are you talking about shame on you
for
writing this shame on you for spending
half of your
budget on this card trick this is the
worst ad i've seen ever
and this is not even sad why did you
spend so much money
and you flattened 14 kids that's
ridiculous that's a ridiculously bad ad
this makes road i mean this doesn't even
accomplish your goal
yeah it's like it's like a call of duty
um
kill streak unlock the nuke or whatever
nintendo ad two brothers
maybe it's like the story of two
brothers who grow up maybe they play a
game like smash bros melee with each
other
maybe they're like you know what let's
get some friends involved and they make
friends through it and build a community
maybe they start to
host a tournament and then nintendo
lovingly as sweet music plays
shows up with a legal team and dmca's
them and their whole family and sues
them for 800 million dollars
that could be like a really fun sweet ad
you know
[Music]
who even are you oh [ __ ]
damn who mega lol him dude
[Laughter]
sick of my energy dude uh a handshake
this is a business relationship at this
point stop playing the victim you need
to calm down no
no don't tell me to calm down you know
what jesus
[Music]
let me tell you something if you have a
frayed relationship with your
brother playing mario kart with him is
not gonna fix it
that's gonna make it worse flash forward
five minutes
you blue shelving dog [ __ ] piece of [ __ ]
[ __ ] can't race like a real man
toss a blue shell you don't deserve that
[ __ ] this is just like back in school
you cheated there's no shot don't play
play animal crossing if anything
you play mario kart you're gonna hate
that kid you know i've been really funny
if you made this commercial a few years
ago he could have gifted him a wii u and
just said never speak to me again
basically
that's the message if you give someone a
wii u you're basically saying this is
the end

Professional Marketer Breaks Down 5 Amazing Ads - YouTube
welcome to marketing monday on a tuesday
today's topic my top five ads ever the
five ads that had the biggest
impact on me as a marketer now
these are not the best five ads of all
time
okay these are literally just five ads
that have stuck with me
and i think about them when i'm at work
number
five taco bell's blackout campaign
in 2014. to launch taco bell's new
mobile ordering app
with one one thing is it's got a cheesy
voice these are not designed for
consumers to see they're only for other
advertisers to see and they're cheesy
it's a cheesy video
but it explains the ad so ignore the
voice we knew we had to go
uber big on all taco bell's social
channels
or we could shut them all down
and launch their new app a full-scale
blackout across all taco bell's social
media channels
all working to make the message clear
the new way to taco bell was only in the
app
according to the news reports you
blacked out on uh
twitter facebook tumblr and so forth how
long's your blackout
this guy's got to be the worst guy to
interview about this
he doesn't know what twitter facebook
tumblr is
you can tell he's reading off a card
tumblr and so forth
it's always nice now again one of the
things i learned from this is about
earned media
whenever you make a like if you are a
brand and you
do something on your own social media
it's called owned if it's big enough and
viral enough for people to write about
it if there's like news articles picking
up on it and you get a million more
eyeballs that way it's called earned
media
and it's hard to get because most people
don't give a [ __ ] about hearing news
articles about someone else's brand
but because this is a first of its kind
because it was a new idea because it was
so creative
they got a ton of press coverage yeah it
was genius when i was
uh because then this to happen in 2014
that was my first year at twitch
i was a young marketer and i was like
damn that shit's cool
years later when developing a campaign
for nvidia
i took the ideas that i liked about it
and i added more
and created the green out so we did the
green out but instead of just doing what
taco bell did having our own channels
disappear
that's level one we turned it into sort
of a viral thing
so we had hundreds and hundreds of
channels do it so
seven days before the announcement of
the rtx 20 series
all of our stuff go dark our website go
green everything go pure green
everything just disappeared pure green
and then
every day after that a major influencer
like myth
like day nine would just go dead silent
and pure green with no explanation
and so for seven days people started
wondering what the hell is going on
and one cool thing about this campaign
you know
if you're if you're wondering what's
going on and a brand tells you
that's one thing but if you're wondering
what's going on and a friend figures it
out and tells you
that sticks in your brain and it became
like this viral moment there was like
tons of green products with no
explanation and i that literally was
because of the inspiration to talk about
i think the talk about is just so genius
and it made me think of all different
ways you can use social media that's not
boring another thing about this is like
well i guess they probably spend money
with twitter
they spent no money they they literally
just turned their channels off
this is what peak mail performance looks
like
and this my friends is what it smells
like
hi there i'm brandon atriock blevins
professional gamer and
global brand ambassador for dr squash
soap
now when they approach meter i said i'd
only consider it on three conditions
number one that they use simple natural
ingredient the kind you could read on
the back of the box and actually
understand
number two they have a variety of cool
scents like grapefruit ipa
that i would feel cool about wearing and
number three
that new customers could use code dsc
atria on drswatch.com to get 20 off any
order of 20
or more you know what they told me when
i asked for all those things they said
what a coincidence that's exactly
the talking points in our ad read so
here we are
i'm three weeks into using dr squatch
let me tell you it cleared up my back it
smells good
and ari likes it oh wow
yeah it's actually really nice now i
don't have a very high bar for soap but
that
dramatically cleared it so i'm happy to
recommend it uh i appreciate their
support
thank you for supporting marketing

code dsc atriac back to the video so
ad number four and this is stuck with me
and that's red bull stratos
where they did this world record free
fall this is mission control at this
time felix is departing
his airstream badass to be strapped into
the stratos capsule
t-minus one hour 13 minutes we're going
to go on hold
one thing i want you to notice this
actually as we watch i want you to
notice this so red bull spent
65 million dollars on this you don't see
one [ __ ] can of red bull in the
entire thing
65 million dollars they spent on it and
they had the confidence
not to force in a can of red bull at any
moment
there was one by the computer that does
not count that is not product placement
logo out
bro that is not that okay no
you're gonna see very few cans of red
bull
going to see almost zero cans of red
bull in this video
we're at 108 000 feet so the decision
has been made
the baumgartner will jump that's
i can't imagine i can't imagine dude
i think you wait you know what i think
though it's probably less scary
this is wrong probably right it's
probably less scary to jump from this
height
than lower if you're this far up it just
feels like
i can't even see the ground it's weird i
feel like if i was in here and i was
gonna jump i'm like well
you know there's gonna be a long time to
figure this out
that looks so [ __ ] scary i'm wrong
i'm dead wrong oh that looks so scary
oh my god
can you believe red bull created this
whole fake set just to lie about the
earth being round
i can't believe red bull's in on the
illuminati he's falling at 700 miles per
hour
[Music]
it's not about breaking records anymore
what i'm trying to say is and again i
guess there was one can early on but
there's a lot of companies that would
have had this guy land and take a swig
of their drink logo out
and and what they do instead with red
bull red bull finds a way to make the
commercial the event
what happens is over time you do enough
of that and it's like all that cool [ __ ]
has just been like
rubbed under the red bull brand you just
absorbed it you just like a little bit
of scratches of
how cool this guy is rub off on your
brand and it's something i think about
when we try to make some
some kind of events i want to show you
one more red blob that i just think is
phenomenal
and i think about a lot and the story of
this ad is so good
and the humanity of it is so good
it's so [ __ ] creative
daniel i'm gonna shoot the boots off you
if you don't stop mucking about your
bike and come and get your tea
what did she say i understood none of
that
you know it's a red bull ad so they
don't have to force down your throat
they can just make it really really cool
human heart felt heartwarming and by
being consistent over many years
they get way more value than trying to
to farm one ad for a little extra brand
impression so
uh just really impressive let's go to
the next one
number three geico's
unskippable ads a series of ads designed
for youtube pre-rolls so
uh what do you say i
say savings
you can't skip this guy goad because
it's already over geico
15 minutes could save you 15 or more on
car insurance
oh hold the door thank you so much um
okay i'll just do it myself then
[Laughter]
so that's the ad but there's there's
multiples they all revolved around they
would get the point across in the first
i don't know the first few seconds
before you could hit skip they would get
the point across
end with something funny and then
everything out there would be per comedy
despite still being funny and being one
of the least skipped out ever
they managed to keep their logo front
and center for the entire thing
it's 60 unbroken seconds of using a
geico logo and it's enjoyable
it's one of the first ads i've seen
where they recognize how
important where you're watching it is to
the ad experience
and so they built an ad entirely about
where he'd be watching it which is
youtube
don't thank me thank the savings you
can't skip this guy go at
because it's already over
he chomping i
zero percent retract i think this is
just these are just good it's creative
the kid's breaking very very good very
creative from geico
ad number two as i mentioned these are
the ads that i
was inspired by and this was one of the
first ones i
particular i don't even like the product
but it was one of the first
ads that opened my eyes to this whole
concept of like
don't talk about blah blah blah our
product is 40 percent
better at or we have 13 more memory or
whatever it just
the whole idea of like trying to like
logically argue your way to a better
product in marketing
i don't even think this ad is like that
good but it was the most blatant and i
saw it when i was young
and it just sort of opened my eyes so
i'm gonna show it to you right now i'm
gonna stop
hello i'm a mac and i'm a pc you know we
use a lot of the same kinds of programs
yeah like microsoft office
but uh we retain a lot of what makes us
us you should see what this guy can do
with a spreadsheet
it's insane oh shucks yeah and he knows
that i'm better at live stuff like music
pictures movies stuff like that well
what what exactly do you mean by better
by
better i mean making a website or photo
book is easy for me and for you
it's not what other kind the general
ideas
they were just so brazenly nakedly open
about saying cool people young creative
attractive lucky people use our product
and out of date wife hates them
businessman uses their product they had
i mean it was like cutting to the core
of branding
they were just like these guys are nerds
and losers and we're gonna show it to
you
and these guys are cool and young and
hip and funny and and witty
and they didn't have to go too much in
detail on why the mac was better they
didn't talk about speed or
price or powerful and knowing human
psychology and it worked i think we all
know that it worked i mean apple
especially in the years since these ads
aired this is not the only reason of
course but
has built one of the strongest brands in
global history
and they i mean literally there's 38
minutes of this they just found every
different way to say
pc users are losers and i think about
them i think about how
like you don't have to be too subtle
that's the lesson i took from this as a
marketer
is that you really you don't have to
because apple's like the best brand like
in the world and they did this ad
for years and it's like oh i don't need
to be too clever
i just sort of need to let people know
what our values are
and be actually kind of blatant with it
because most people are kind of dumb
the one more thing i learned from apple
is the power of
product as a marketing feature and it
was entirely
from this green bubbles and blue bubbles
which seems like [ __ ] nothing but
it's like
probably made them billions of dollars
this is literally a wall street journal
article about how it makes switching to
android because the color of your
bubbles will change
the simple fact that you get a blue
bubble on the iphone and they make the
the android ones green has caused people
to not switch
it's crazy and it seems small but it's
been so effective and it's like
these tiny details matter to how the
people that use your products see
themselves
everyone in chat who's like lmao green
betas
you might have bought too much into the
marketing you might have been followed a
little bit too much for it but uh yeah i
mean
you know i can't blame them it worked
the thing is the the five head move is
if you have no friends and no one texts
you back
you'll never know what color bubbles you
have so number one
[Music]
chat you are not going to believe this
chat you are not going to believe this
wow what an amazing ad that's gotta be
i'm choking guys you're so dumb
sometimes
number one is um nike when i created
when i pitched again there's a lot of
people that worked on this thing but the
pitch for the original idea for frames
win games for nvidia
it was literally me trying to think of
what is a gaming version of just do it
i was just i'm so obsessed with how nike
approaches marketing
but i'm gonna show you two that to me
are like all timers that i think of all
time
greatness it's just something we made up
greatness is not some rare dna strand
it's not some precious thing
greatness is no more unique to us than
breathing we're all capable of it
just one minute long unbroken shot of a
guy starting his
jogging regime it's such a powerful
image it's such a break from what they
normally do with the best
fittest strongest athletes in the world
they don't focus they don't zoom in on
the shoes
they don't talk about how and now and
the air max souls makes it easier to
begin your jogging journey they just
associate
their brand with the beginning of a
self-improvement physical journey
which is dope as hell it's simple it's
beautiful it's clean and it's a great ad
i think about i go back to it all the
time
i'm gonna show you one more that i found
to be super impressive only because i've
heard
the marketers that create it talk about
the thought process this is when
nike was getting into skateboarding and
uh they didn't know anything about
skateboarding they weren't seen as an
authentic skate brand
and they realized that like if they came
off as like the big corporation that
didn't know about skateboarding
it wasn't gonna sell with authentic
actual people that skate so
they really did their research the
marketers talked about this they really
did their research on like what were
actual problems that skaters faced what
they thought about what they thought was
funny
and they came up with a series of ads
about the world if other sports were
treated like skaters
i think it was just like a good lesson
for me as a marketer on how
how important it is to like do your
research to really understand who you're
talking to so anyway let's watch them
all i want to do all we want to do is
just
run man just run
you're crazy people i don't get regular
guys
as soon as we do this we're criminals
you have to do that here we get a lot of
stairs we get a lot of smokes
people are unpleasant and rude
now i'll go through the same thing
you know they're just they're funny and
they're creative and they're authentic
and if you're a skater
you don't see that ad and be like wow
they don't get me you don't you feel
like you're
you're understood for a bit so and
that's why they're my number one that i
look to the most
anyway those are that's it that's my top
five ads
of all time hope you enjoyed

The Best Company April Fools Pranks Ever - YouTube
today's topic on marketing monday
april fool's that's right
april fool's the one day of the year
corporations can just cut loose
have a little bit of fun you know you
know it's all it's all
it's all business all year for these
corporations but they can do a little
trolling
they can put on their problem face and
they can
uh they can make the magic happen okay
so today we're gonna talk about
corporate april fool's jokes and find
some of the best and the worst ones
and we shall include an april fool's
video
that i wrote and starred in uh for
nvidia
we will be including that one this one
i'm going to start with the company who
we really roasted on previous marketing
monday
and that of course is burger king we
really
laid into burger king about two
marketing mondays ago
today i'm gonna be showing their april
fool's joke
the chocolate whopper chocolate whopper
coming soon what's funny is if it had
been popular enough i think they would
have made it but
it wasn't that popular i think um it all
depends
how you think this one did all depends
on how you think this looks
if you think this looks kind of yummy
then it was a good ad
because it's like it associates their
brand with something yummy and it's
funny and it's kind of clever
to me this looks gross as [ __ ] so i
don't know it's tough for me to say i
think
i think that looks really nasty and just
it furthers my brand perception of
burger king as having gross food
was it the nasty patty that looks like
the nasty fatty
yeah i don't know again this feels like
something that was kind of clever
but in practice i just feel like they
they they lost the plot this feels like
classic burger king ad where they just
love being clever dude
like what if we made the tomatoes out of
sugar and we you know like
and and the bun was a cookie and you
know it's like all right but at the end
of the day does it look gross
because then we have another piece of
gross food that we're spending air time
on
i literally think if they just fired
their entire marketing team and just
showed
30 seconds unbroken of a whopper looking
tasty
just unbroken just looking pretty good
and then it says the whopper
end scene and like you just do that over
and over again
i literally think that would have 99 000
better
returns i literally would be like okay
all right bro i kind of want a whopper
now it actually looks kind of good
mcdonald's is much better at this um
so yeah i don't know this was not
accessible april fool's to me i think
the
the mark of a good april fool's ad let's
actually cover this right now i think
the mark of a good april fool's ad
is that it it takes things that are your
core brand values things you want people
to know about you
things that are are central to your
brand
and pushes them to extremes in a funny
way you know
so let me show you example of a really
good april fool's ad this is an all-time
great
at google we seek to hire the most
exceptional people
already enforcing their perception as
like a high-end
like the place where the best people
work i mean you guys remember that movie
with um
with vince vaughn and owen wilson you
probably don't cause no one watched it
this was literally like an ad like
google paid for most of this movie
google like supplied the funds to make
this movie happen
because it's literally like a long ass
ad for google it just talks about how
smart googlers are
how much different the google wallet
like it's basically just to get people
to work at google
and to want to work at google right so
already they're starting off with that
we hire the best people
today we're announcing a new job role
and challenge
[Music]
pokemon master uh
i mean it's a brilliant cross promotion
with pokemon it makes google seem like a
cool
fun irreverent place to work it looks
real
it ties in with their products already
but like to an extreme it wasn't
possible yet
it it it was just uh it's a slam dunk
this is a huge pr win for google it got
picked up
by a million news articles writing about
gradebook fool's pranks
so the chocolate whopper is kind of a
bad one this is kind of a good one i'm
not [ __ ] on burking every time but i
just want you to know that
i haven't seen uh i haven't seen a
i legit thought this was real when it
came out
wait how did you think it was an ad
pokemon go no you didn't think it was an
ad pokemon go when it came out
because pokemon go was not out yet
no you didn't think that it would be
years before pokemon go existed
this is one of my favorite my favorite
april fool's pranks of all time
because like i said a good april fool's
prank
really ties to your corporate brand
values you know it's something that
people could see
being real it's close to being real but
a little out of reach
okay and that of course is the one
where elon musk
tweeted that tesla was going bankrupt
that was a good april fool's prank
because you know what
i was pretty [ __ ] sure it was true
completely and totally bankrupt so
bankrupt you can't believe it
wait this is actually one of the
all-timers
[Music]
here at duolingo we know that learning a
language works best
when you practice every day that's why
duolingo sends helpful notifications to
users
to remind them to practice practice
practice but for some users

enough
that's why we're excited to launch a
brand new
premium feature duolingo push

you are

streak
a subtle reminder the green glove
treatment that you've been waiting for a
real life reminder that
you can't ignore you can choose
a reminder that's best oh god
encouraging duo disappointed duo
passive aggressive duo sign up today

okay
i'm doing it absolutely excellent ad
dude absolutely excellent at
excellent ad excellent april fool's joke
it leaned into the meme pushed the only
thing they're missing was the gun
you know because the meme has a gun and
i really wish that he just had a blicky
on him
a minecraft april fool's prank minecraft
oh [ __ ] dude what if
what if this would obviously only be a
prank this would only be a prank what if
they
banned dream for a day i feel like
people would freak
out too far yeah you're right actually
too far well actually too far
actually too far what if they banned
everyone else's butt dream
now that's a good april fool's prank and
they just called it dreamcraft
a playstation april fool's joke let's
see what playstation did
playstation really leads the way with
innovative ideas and technology
here at the wearables division we're
working on ways of bringing the
playstation experience
to all areas of your life building on
the recent success of remote play and
chair play and not to mention
project morpheus we're about to take
gaming
to a deeper level underwater
environments and games like
the last of us remastered are more
realistic than ever
to enhance the gameplay experience we've
developed an advanced new wearable
technology
playstation flow when you get to a
swimming environment in your game
simply pause the game sync your
playstation flow goggles
and grab your flow sensors then head to
your nearest swimming pool
and dive right back into the action
your movement bro so many kids would
drown
it would be like it would just be an
epidemic of drowning
i i the amount of kids that would drown
would be like
off the charts controls your game
character
and with the waterproof earphones you
get a totally
immersive experience
playstation have really taken the plunge
they've thrown themselves into the
obviously april fool's joke but just
thinking about it feasibly for a few
seconds you just imagine how many times
you'd slam your head
full speed into the wall of the pool we
also wanted to make sure you could get
back to playing the game on your ps4 as
quickly as possible
we've developed an incredible new way to
draw yourself it's a massive leap
forward
the playstation flow body dryer it'll
draw you in seconds
we're really excited about playstation
flow it's potential to break through
traditional gaming barriers is immense
you know what they should have done was
had an xbox like red ring of deathing
and overheating
you can use one of these old things it's
like just
[Music]
and that's how you dry off you don't
even have to be in a
pool to experience it
[Music]
playstation flow one serious piece of
technology
[Music]
i think that's pretty good i think
there's two ways you can go with this
kind of thing
if you're doing like new tech like new
product you can go like super
goofy like this or you can go like on
the edge of believable
people were like oh [ __ ] i wish that was
real it's time
now it's time to show you
an april fool's that i worked on
okay let's go nvidia geforce is
always introducing new ways to move

The 5 Dumbest Company Buyouts in History - YouTube
you might be wondering
why all the money was on fire in the
intro
because today is the top five times
companies lit billions of dollars on
fire
the five worst buyouts
in corporate history we don't hear about
these as often
sometimes a company will buy a company
for a lot of money
and then realize oh [ __ ] we've
goofed it so to speak today we're
talking about those
let's get to the top five baby yahoo
buys tumblr
i thought long and hard about how i was
gonna explain
the myriad of ways this was a dumb deal
so i thought what's a hot meme right now
oh those trade deals memes trade offer
you receive 1.1 billion no i receive
1.1 billion dollars you receive
3 million a few years later and a bunch
of furry porn
marissa mayer ceo of yahoo basically
spent
1.1 billion dollars 1.097 billion
dollars
for a lot of furry porn
that's that's essentially it so
the plan was um
for the ss yahoo here to be pulled by
tumblr
into the future tumblr was big with
millennials which at the time
what we called zoomers millennials
loved this internet thing they loved
mimi's and
tumblr got it and yahoo wanted a piece
of that
what she didn't understand was the sheer
amount of
porn on the website as well a lot of
porn
not just the memes but a lot of porn
so when she
bought the company for 1.1 billion
dollars the
the plan that she enacted after a year
was a revenue goal she said all right
okay first she said she's going to be
hands off
the first thing she said was all right
yahoo's going to be hands off because we
don't get it we know you guys
you tumblr you guys are hip we're going
to be hands off
but then about a year pass and they
realize all right well we did spend a
billion dollars and you're not making
any money
tomorrow we just realized you're not
making any money so now
you have a we're setting an ultimatum
you have to make a hundred million
dollars this year
that was where and apparently the truth
is we're from reading into it
that number was completely pulled out of
her ass there was no like math behind it
she was just like all right make a
hundred million dollars this year
and so now the ad sales team at tumblr
is freaking out
they're like how the [ __ ] are we going
to sell that many ads and they start
like desperately calling everybody and
trying to sell the ads
and what they realize is most big
companies that spend a lot of money on
ads
don't really want to be next to furry
porn frantically
tumblr banned all porn because they had
to hit that goal if you wonder why
tumblr out of the blue banned porn
it's because they had to hit a hundred
million dollars but all that did
was drive the few people that were still
using tumblr off the website
i mean without the porn tumblr was just
old memes at that point because
the rise of snapchat and other companies
at this time was now
eating heavily in tumblr's market share
so
with a one-two punch they just killed
tumblr and by the way they did not hit
the revenue goal
and uh then yahoo offloaded tumblr for i
think like
um three million dollars
three three million dollars dude they
offloaded tumblr for like what
ludwig made during the subathon this is
what a billion
and one dollars looks like this is what
three million dollars looks like
they they just burned this money uh
number four is a two-parter
starting with microsoft
buying nokia in 2012.
now if you're wondering who these people
are that's the ceo of nokia
smiling because he just made a ton of
money for
bad phones and this is the ceo of
microsoft steve ballmer
smiling because he's an idiot but he did
have that moment
famously developers developers
developers developers developers
developers developers developers
anyway it goes over three minutes but
you get the idea he was a big
sweaty loud yelling man who had gotten
obscenely rich as microsoft grew in the
90s
and essentially ran it into the nowhere
it didn't go down it didn't go up it
just stayed still for like 10 years
and then they got a new ceo and now
microsoft's worth like a trillion
dollars so
but he brilliantly in 2012 realized hey
you know this iphone thing that came out
five years ago
it's doing pretty well we should get in
on that so
five years after the iphone they decided
to make their own they thought okay we
have to get into that game
mobile's getting kind of big and so
acting with the speed that you can tell
this man has
they bought um nokia
uh for seven billion dollars okay they
made
famously the windows phone what
a gorgeous piece of tech the nokia
windows phone
can you guys even remember what life was
like before our windows phones
anyway uh turns out this did not
light the world on fire just so we don't
forget
microsoft acquired all these buildings
right i mean when they got them uh by
the end of it
in 2015 this is two years later
only two years after owning the company
that had lasted forever
they fired 15 000 employees
and they wrote off a 7.6 billion dollar
loss
now they only paid 7 billion to buy it
so
they they bought it and then had to
write off
7.6 billion more 15 000
fired money lost left and right no phone
sold nokia brand collapsed
all because they thought they could
compete with the iphone but
google said you know let's not get
outdone here
okay let's not get out done here we can
spend a lot of money on phones too
so famously uh google bought
motorola and they said all right
seven billion for a phone company that's
that's chump change
all right we're gonna let's do you one
bigger let's go 12 and a half
so that they bought motorola for 12 and
a half thinking all right
now that's gonna [ __ ] over the iphone
but the problem was
motorola couldn't make good phones this
might not even be google's fault i don't
know
but let me tell you motorola could not
make a quality phone to compete in the
modern smartphone
era and so by 2014 which was only two
years after they bought them
google thought that the phones they were
making were so ugly and poorly
constructed
that while they still owned motorola
they went to samsung and lg and begged
them to make their phones for them
and in 2014 they sold them off realizing
it was a bad deal
for 2 billion so if you're doing the
math that's 10 billion dollars lost in
two years
on a bunch of shitty phones that didn't
sell and that is why it is in my top
four
what a stupid stupid acquisition
uh number three all right to understand
number three you have to watch this clip
okay we take this thing called the radio
and put it on this new thing called
the internet next thing you know we ipo
stock triples in the day and aol gobbles
us up
so that's mark cuban
to a t that is literally the story of
mark
cuban because number three
radio on the internet was yahoo's
acquisition of broadcast.com
in the late 90s at the height of the
dot-com
when anything you could say anything on
the internet you'd make a bunch of money
mark cubit
invented broadcast.com radio on the
internet
now think remember twitch is essentially
the modern version of broadcast.com
right but with actual video
uh twitch sold for about one billion
dollars a little under one billion
okay broadcast.com in the 90s
sold for 5.7 billion
basically six times twitch i think
at the math they literally could have
like
they could have given people a thousand
dollars to try broadcast.com
and it would have been a better use of
money and mark cuban
was not dumb in this mark cuban was
maybe a scammer
but he did not think that radio on the
internet was smart because the second he
got his yahoo stock
the second he sold all of it that he
could
and the stuff he couldn't sell he made a
bet
uh it's called a strangle in options but
he basically had made a bet that it
would go down
and so when it did go down because he
couldn't sell it
he made money off that he basically knew
instantly
and he used that to get a billion
dollars join the trace commerce club
and buy dallas mavericks and he's never
been out of our cultural consciousness
ever since
yeah it was i'm sorry i'm just to
confirm it was ten
thousand dollars per user they had about
half a million users
on broadcast.com half million users for
5.7 billion
is it's just so stupid
were they outbidding anyone i don't even
think so
there wasn't even a bidding war bro it
was just like yahoo's like we can't
i don't even ask for one we won't give
it to you we'll give you five you you
deserve
too much king radio on the internet that
is genius
number two now i think you
zoomers might remember
something that happened in about 2007
2008
maybe you remember it was a big economic
thing maybe you remember it so
right before that
like actually basically as it was
happening not even before it but like as
everyone was like oh [ __ ]
this housing bubble's kind of bursting
bank of america
acquired countrywide which is a mortgage
lending firm
now you could be forgiven for not
knowing countrywide banking and home
loans
again what zoomer or millennials ever
gonna buy a house we wouldn't know what
this is but it's the largest mortgage
lender in america so they had they had
they had lended a bunch of mortgages to
people across the country
um at the height of the housing boom
and bank of america said holy [ __ ] this
mortgage business looks great
this looks [ __ ] awesome you guys are
making money hand over fist let's buy
you
so they bought countrywide for two
billion dollars
and that seems cheap at the time
everyone's like wow what a great deal
why was countrywide willing to sell for
only two billion they're making money
hand over fist
two billion dollars is nothing this is a
great deal
for most exact questions look if you buy
tumblr for 1.1 billion and tumblr goes
to zero
then what you've lost is 1.1 billion
that's terrible
but if you buy a company that lends
people money
then you've also acquired their debt
so you could lose more than what you
paid
so bank of america bought countrywide
for 2.2 billion dollars
and that's a lot of money of course but
if they had just
lost that it would be like ah whatever
you know damn we made a mistake
that was dumb but they also acquired
all of countrywide's outstanding debt
and they found out instantly like the
second the deal was signed
the housing market started really
collapsing
and they started realizing all of these
mortgages were lended to people who
can't pay them back
which means that it's just a bunch of
outstanding debt
and within a few months i believe
bank of america had to pay 50 billion
dollars
in outstanding debt on the countrywide
mortgages
which means they spent two billion for
the right to spend
50 billion
which really is the dumbest
[ __ ] thing i've ever heard
i'm so shocked that we live in a world
where this is not number one
i'm shocked but there is a worse one
spending two billion dollars for the
right to lose 50 billion
there's someone's been dumber than that
drumroll please
worst merger acquisition of all time let
me set the stage
it took place again at the height of the
dot-com bubble
i'm gonna show you a company every day
america online is making it easier
called america
online play all you need is a computer
and a regular phone line they send you
the software and give you ten free hours
to check it out
ten free hours now for your free america
online so you might notice a couple
things from this commercial of america
online at its peak
one most importantly they charged you by
the hour
and it was slow it was
dial-up that charged you by the hour
that's a business model that could never
go out of style so let me show you
their stock chart this is it 1992 the
company's
goes public for 61 million dollars
by 97 they're worth 4 billion people
love them
by 98 they're worth 19 billion by 99
they're worth 105 billion
by 2 000 they're worth 160 billion
dollars
one of the most valuable media companies
on planet earth
at this 160 billion dollar market cap
which i'm sure will rise even more to
the moon
like gamestop stock at this point
they decided they wanted to go shopping
and they
found a sucker
let me show you this man this man
was the ceo of time
warner communications and
because of the magic of uh the internet
and the magic of people getting way too
excited about stocks
coffee gamestop cough dogecoin
cough tesla this is about what aol
actually
made was worth this much
and time warner which made about
this much money it was kind of worth
what it made because it was an old media
company so people think it wasn't going
to grow
so time warner was despite making about
you know 10x what aol did it was worth
about half
and so aol was like okay we'll buy you
and time warner should have been like
[ __ ] you we make way more money than you
we should buy you
you're a scam but instead they said
oh [ __ ] really we'd love to be part of
the internet
we don't really get it this is an old
clip
of them quizzing the ceo on why he would
do this deal 80
of the cash flow of this combined
company will come from your company and
yet
your shareholders will own only 45 why
were you willing to sign off in the deal
oh well
pretty clearly you know if you looked at
last friday the market cap of aol was
twice the size of
time warner i've made a judgment
which i i believe to be correct that
going forward the time warner
shareholders will be
much better off owning 45 percent
of aol time warner than 100 percent of
time warner
yeah he was wrong he was wrong
so instead of owning all of a big
media company he gave up over half of
his company
they definitely knew he didn't know
because if you want to know
what he thinks about this they actually
interviewed i found an interview with
him
years later he said i'd like to forget
it
i almost didn't do this interview
because i didn't want to take it up
again let it pass in history
this should pass into history like the
vietnam war and the iraq and afghanistan
wars
it's one of the biggest disasters that
have occurred to our country
i lost 80 percent of my worth and
subsequently lost my
job we looked it up to see if i was the
biggest loser of all time because i lost
about eight billion dollars
personally that guy in the clip earlier
the second the deal completes this
happens
let's pull it up and get rid of my black
boxes
it goes from this to this
because this thing called broadband
comes out
and people don't want to pay by the hour
so
all of this aol stock by the way this
deal was done with stock
what that means is they bought time
warner cable with aol stock
so everyone at time warner just got aol
stock they didn't get money
the next year not only do they lose all
that money they have to do a write down
of drum roll please
99 billion dollars
lost in a single quarter the highest
loss
in business history everyone involved
lost money
tons of people were fired it was a
massive blow up massive disaster
and both companies have been worse ever
since that's the end of the story except
for one thing
but this guy scott ahrens said together
they're an unprecedented powerhouse
if their mantra is content this alliance
is unbeatable
now they have this great platform they
can fertilize with content
just buzzwords just trash buzzwords the
kind of [ __ ] people say about dogecoin
and [ __ ]
tesla today but i was like you know what
i'm kind of interested
where is scott aaron's now i just i saw
this article i was like you know this
guy
was so [ __ ] wrong i wonder what he's
doing now
so i googled him i just i did some i did
some some little light estalking
and i i found out he had done an
interview
uh with people asking uh with pbs pbs
did an expose they were asking
why the [ __ ] did uh all these dot-com
stocks crash like how did everyone get
so duped
because he said like he said pets.com
was going to the moon
he said theglobe.com was going to the
moon they looked at all of his history
because what analysts do right is they
recommend to the public
if you should buy or sell or hold a
stock and they looked at all of his
recommendations they realized
over his entire career he never
ever said to sell and he told the public
to buy buy buy
okay and they found out he never
ever ever issued a cell and pbs started
calling him out on pbs was like hey
what you're doing is corrupt he said
right here i found this line they said
you never said you don't like a stock
you always said you liked it you said no
he said that's not true at all i said i
didn't like stocks all the time
and then they said do you remember an
example and he said yeah
i said it about amazon i was one of the
first people to turn
negative on amazon
that was the one example in his whole
career
of pumping shitty internet stocks
of a time he said you shouldn't buy
so i just want to close this targeting
tuesday
by saying i think i found the biggest
idiot in wall street history
if you had just inversed every one of
this guy's bets you'd be a billionaire
anyway that's the end of target who's
the top five worst
acquisitions of all time thank you for
watching
targeting tuesday in the books
say bye to youtube bye youtube
oh
THE TRIAL OF THE CENTURY HAS BEGUN - YouTube
today's topic the long
oh long have we waited the apple
versus epic lawsuit kicked off
today tim sweeney versus tim
cook literally
they might fist fight logan paul style
it could not have
kicked off in a more perfect way
the apple versus epic lawsuit was held
online
it is essentially done with the
arguments done over zoom
children found the link
and started immediately joining the call
and screaming at the top of their lungs
to a federal judge free fortnight
the court could not properly mute all
participants for more than
20 minutes so an actual court case
between
a trillion dollar company and a
multi-billion dollar company
was full of children screaming basically
over discord
they played travis scott tunes
advertised their youtube channel
screamed free fortnite please bring
fortnite back on mobile judge
uh i mean i was in there plugging my
channel i hope i hope to see some of you
in chat i hope some of you showed up
yo sweetie wait okay wait this is an
actual clip from right before
tim sweeney took to make his opening uh
his welcoming arguments
tim swinney's the ceo of epic games
yo sweetie dog you suck
i don't know these i don't know if they
can even hear me
they could bro they could
you don't have to be a redditor to sing
fortnite's dog come on
you don't have to be a redditor to say
fortnite sucks
and that was actually apple's lawyer
that was apple's opening argument that
wasn't even a kid
they paid a lot of money for that
that was a powerful statement and that
really put
that put epic on the back foot right one
you want to ever
i'm playing travis scott in the
background just so they can break down
you guys mute yo can you guys meet
though no cat like i don't i'm trying to
hear yeah please then some kid
can you mute no cat i'm trying to learn
this i actually really want to know
how this battle over percentages of
revenue
is gonna affect the future of our nation
so if you guys could just shut the
up
no cat to let you know that i did my
research
both apple and epic put out 100-page
powerpoints
explaining their arguments and i went
through all of them
it turns out they're not that funny
they're kind of just
serious and they really care about
winning this argument and they didn't
like throw in a bunch of funny jokes
anyway so apple opened with a steve jobs
quote and that is a hard
quote to beat we're trying to do two
diametrically post things at once
provide an advanced and open platform to
developers while at the same time
protect iphone users from viruses
malware privacy attacks etc this is no
easy task
basically the core of today's argument
is between epic games
who says that the apple app store is an
unfair monopoly
that takes 30 percent of everyone that
does anything on it
and they don't allow you to do any other
payment method of payment
and apple who says we need to take that
money because we provide a great service
because of it
we use the money to stop malware stop
viruses
to weed out bad stuff we need that money
if you don't like it you can shop
somewhere else
that is the crux of the argument okay
and so obviously
to counteract that epic had a quote of
their own
the phrase it's such a it's just a game
it's such a weak mindset okay
you're okay with what happened losing
imperfection of a craft when you stop
getting angry after losing you've lost
twice
tim sweeney stood up on stage and
delivered this quote
in a ninja headband passionately
and at this point people thought the the
the trial might even be over
it was such a powerful comeback what's
interesting about this lawsuit is that
because it's a lawsuit
a lot of private emails are getting
brought public
both sides are able to um request
private emails from the other side to
use to prove their case and they're
getting
made public one of the big reveals of
the apple versus epic
fight and all the emails that are
leaking is
is actually the emails from sony to epic
because if you guys
remember when fortnite was at its
absolute biggest in 2018
um sony was the big holdout on crossplay
after all the sony said about how
they love the idea
of crossplay that you have to get it
right the leak basically proves that
sony hated crossplay
what i love about this email exchange is
how
 cocky epic game sounds in 2018.
this is from sony the guy from sony says
sorry if you feel it's me too slowly
i was under the impression there was no
movement with microsoft either this is
very passive-aggressive
i'm trying to decipher this business
speak for you guys this is just very
passive-aggressive email
has that changed he's basically saying
 you microsoft's not doing it either
we're not gonna move microsoft isn't
doing either all right
now i appreciate the points you listed
in the email there's a lot of great
ideas here for canadian partnership
however cross-platform play is not a
slam dunk no matter
the size of the title basically saying
don't get too big for your
britches i don't care you're the biggest
game on playstation
as you know many companies are exploring
this idea and not a single one can
explain
how cross-platform play improves the
playstation business
basically what that means is
we're not making money off this if we go
cross-platform
it doesn't make money for us you know
what makes us money
is getting a ton of kids to play it on
playstation and get their friends to
play on playstation
that and we all know that whatever
console is winning
hates cross-platform whatever console is
losing
loves cross-platform that's it none of
them are heroes
none of them like players it's a pretty
um
subtle but straightforward shutting down
like hell no
and what's funny is epic literally whips
out their dong dude
and comes back so hard and by the way if
you're wondering how they can talk to
sony like this
this is 2018 this is peak fortnite
he comes back with this we love working
with playstation and we want this to be
a win-win
the longer this drags out it will be
less so
i cannot think of a scenario where epic
doesn't get what we want
that possibility went out the door when
fortnite became the biggest game on
playstation
i've never even i couldn't imagine
talking to a sony executive like that
bro he came back so hard we announced
cross play in conjunction with sony
we'll go out of our way to make you look
like heroes you get to pick when where
and how but we're gonna do it
also they threaten their ue4 license
this is also very subtle at the end
i don't think i've if you guys don't
know epic also does unreal engine which
is where a lot of games are based off of
a lot of games are built on the unreal
engine they suddenly say
i don't think i mentioned this before
but your license to use unreal engine 4
expires in may 2019 that license has
some really great terms
now again the way it's worded is so
careful
because if they did actually threaten
that they would like you know
pull their access to it that would be
illegal or at least a cause for you know
a lawsuit it's a very careful wording
sony uh epic apple there are no heroes
in this story
i want that to be clear none of these
companies is thinking about anything
other than how do they get themselves
rich
but and i will say this i'll just say it
up front
i do lean towards the side of
epic um epic's argument and i'll explain
why later
but generally if you're arguing between
a trillion dollar company and a billion
dollar company
they're both but the billion
dollar company winning does not make
them
into a trillion dollar company it just
makes both companies a little less
dominant
okay let's make this a huge win for us
all epic is
not changing its mind on the issue so
let's just agree on it now
that is the most cold final line i've
ever seen
in a email i could never imagine
i'm not at that level in my career
i could never imagine talking to another
company's like top executives and being
like i'm not changing my mind
so let's just agree on it now and that
just shows you how
powerful epic was when they had fortnite
in 2018
and what's funny is like if you read
some of the more recent emails
fortnite's still doing well but they
don't talk like this anymore
epic is always like hey let's be friends
this was leaked also from the thing epic
games in 2018 and 2019
made nine billion dollars in revenue off
of basically just fortnight battle
passes and skins
so epic games is a lot of things they
run unreal engine
they did fortnite they have the epic
game store they have rocket league
let me show you okay all right this is
rocket league 100 million
rocket league plus battle breakers
plus other games okay all the way up
here
at 200 million unreal engine
licensing they basically make the engine
for like
every popular game and they made about
200 million dollars from that
and then this is what they made off
fortnite
and that is the rest of their company
it's not even to scale this would go up
so much higher
5.4 billion dollars probably more like
this
okay this is more realistic
all right so epic games despite
seeming like a big broad company is
actually just the fortnite company
uh this is pre-epic story yes but the
epic store wouldn't change it
and in fact apple sort of ripped into
him
apple said the epic game store will not
be profitable for at least
multiple years if ever and because of
the documents that was leaked
we actually found out they're losing
about 300 million dollars in the store
and the fortnight money's going down
realistically epic games had
two years where they made absolute
infinity bucks
from fortnite now fortnite's going down
a little bit and the epic game store
um experiment has thus far yet to even
come close turning a profit it's
actually lost 300 million dollars
this is why i sort of side with epic in
general is because they're not a company
that has
too much weight to throw around anymore
not as much they're still powerful and
big obviously
but they're not they're nowhere near the
the ironclad
multi i mean apple has more money than
epic made off fortnite
in their bank account they have like 50
billion dollars just in a war chest
and that's more than epics ever made do
you know what i'm saying so epic games
is the little guy here
by a lot this is apple review process in
their own words
uh apple's review process is more like
the pretty lady who greets you with a
lay at hawaiian airport than a drug
sniffing dog
is no one reviewing these apps there's
no one minding this or this is insane
apple review is bringing a plastic
butter knife to a gunfight
shocking dozens these are all internal
emails from apple by the way
what they've sort of found is the main
thing apple reviews for
is to find if you're cheating them out
of their money
the main thing they look for is they
really go in detail to find if there's
any way
that you could pay on that app without
using apple pay without using through
the apple store payments
that's the main thing they check for and
that is not a good reason to demand 30
of
everyone's money of spotify's income of
epic's income
it's not a good enough reason 2008 was
the very beginning of the app
store and they found this email where
an apple executive was talking about hey
look at this
some games are starting to have a
healthy aftermarket
in additional game levels enhanced
graphics for a fee
there's money being made on
microtransactions and we're not getting
a cut of that
because back then the app store didn't
care about that it was only for the
initial download
and they said we'll have to make sure
our terms don't allow this
it's a possible leak in the system and
so this is
pretty compelling evidence they knew
what was going on
they didn't need this and they just
wanted the cut they just wanted the fat
stacks
and despite the fact that yes steve jobs
keeps saying
he kept saying the app store is not
about making money
mr jobs said we don't expect the app
store to be a big profit generator
we don't intend to make money off the
app store the app store
makes a ton of money the app store
is one of the most profitable things in
the history of technology
it literally prints money because you
have to do no work
apple does barely any work and they get
an insane amount of money
rolling in they get a cut off clash of
clans money
they get a cut off spotify money they
get to cut off temple run money
they get to cut off anything anyone
designs and it's a third
they get a third of your money so
this is cap and there is a good point
in what they're saying here uh from epic
now
i have to go back here and show that
epic is
is not innocent
because as much as epic talks about this
being for the good of everyone
and how important it is for small
developers that's only the case
now after they secretly tried
to get a special side deal from apple
apple
i mean epic basically came to him and
said look we get it hey you wanna make
fat stacks we're gonna do a store pretty
soon we're gonna make fat snacks we get
it
but we're fortnite okay we're the big
dogs
so you give us a secret deal where we
don't pay the 30
and we'll go our own way all right you
know
 it and apple said no we never
even heard of fortnite bro we're
so big we don't give two shits we'll
never cut our deal for anyone
that's essentially what happened apple
is so big that even fortnite in the
height of 2018 means nothing
so what they did to kick this whole
thing off is
uh epic game updated their game they
updated ios game of fortnite
with secret code that would only trigger
at a later date
so when it got reviewed by apple's
amazing reviewers
they didn't notice it and the secret
code after a later date
triggered and unlocked a new store this
store
where you could pay directly they
basically said it we're doing it
they went around apple's review store of
course
they knew it would get caught the second
it went up
uh apple uh flipped a and apple
and google both removed fortnite from
their stores
because they wanted 30 cup but the
second this happened
it kicked off this legal battle and they
needed this to happen because
um epic needed to be kicked off the app
store
in order to have grounds for a lawsuit
that apple was anti-competitive
oh and then this part was a pretty good
argument because
look here's the deal apple sony nintendo
google samsung they all take 30
okay everyone takes 30 on their store
basically if you capture users
that can only use your platform
everyone's like oh now i can make
money
if epic wins this lawsuit apple says
then all these other people will lose
money too
which is not really a bad thing but
they're kind of trying to scare
the judge and scare they're basically
trying to scare a lot of people to be
like
look who knows what could happen
who knows what could happen everyone
could lose money
i i would like a world where this 30
 is reduced
reduced or removed because
a lot of innovation has now been stifled
down to a few
gigantic corporations basically just
rolling in free cash on everyone else's
innovations
you know what actually while lawsuit
fever is going around
i'd like to stop to a second and i want
to sue twitch
wait a minute i'm going to get banned
because
they don't even take 30 percent of my
 they take a lot more i can't even
say it
legally i can't even say what they take
they take a lot more
twitch ain't out here doing marketing
monday twitch didn't have to read
both powerpoints bro jeff bezos robbing
me blind
i'm gonna get banned here's how it's
gonna happen
here's what's gonna happen i am 99.9
sure that apple will win this argument
for two reasons one
they're just bigger they're just
stronger
and in general um the u.s
especially in recent years has been very
very very
lacks about any uh anti-monopoly um
rulings and so i don't think that apple
will lose now that being said
what usually happens in these cases what
usually happens is
a company stands up
for anti-monopoly activity and they lose
but eventually uh
they're proven right and something
changes let me give you an example
um when microsoft had
uh the dominance of windows in the late
90s
netscape was the biggest browser and
microsoft said nah that
and they bundled internet explorer with
windows
and immediately like overnight like
literally overnight
uh netscape died and netscape said yo
this is illegal this is a monopoly
there's nothing we can do about it and
they sued
and they lost that lawsuit eventually
uh the the the judge did rule i mean the
the
the antitrust of the government ruled
that microsoft was over the line
and they forced them to change some
things which allowed for google and
firefox and other things to grow
i mean eventually it happened what's
probably going to happen here is epic is
going to lose
epic's going to bleed a bunch of money
on the fortnite on the store
fortnite's going to lose its you know
fortnite's gonna die
over time as all games do fortnite's
gonna and
epics gonna drastically scale back their
ambitions because they're not gonna have
as much money
and at which point when they've lost the
ability to like
you know make a bunch of money off
fortnight because it's gone
then someone in the eu or us are gonna
be like hey
apple's a little bit too big though
right and they're gonna change the rules
on 30
so and then in some way they're kind of
a sacrifice they're kind of a martyr
and you got to respect that and so
if you believe in the cause maybe
consider
dusting off the old keyboard pulling out
the controller
and buying a couple v bucks buying a
ninja skin
you know do your part little do you know
how i'm breaking do it for spotify
do it for temple run
do it for ninja
The Dirty Secrets of Food Marketing (ft. BURGZY) - YouTube
marketing monday food marketing edition
featuring burgzy now you might be asking
yourself
why why a track why food marketing
well food marketing is actually really
really interesting and for
one particular reason to me
money that's why i'm interested in food
marketing
there's a lot more of it in food
than in almost any other field of
marketing
and you're probably wondering why you're
thinking atriox that doesn't make any
sense okay you work in tech there's got
to be more money in tech
in gaming you know how big gaming is
well this my friends
is the average amount an american spends
on food annually it's seven
thousand dollars and this is the average
american that includes every american
rich or poor
and when you spend a lot of money on
food that creates a lot of people that
want that money that's a lot of
competition
and when there's a lot of competition
between products that are essentially
indistinguishable
they serve the same need okay your
hunger
the only way they can differentiate
themselves is through marketing and so
the marketing in fact
in food has gotten extremely good for
example
if i were to buy engine parts okay
those are very specialized i i have
exactly what i want in mind then i go to
get it okay so marketing is not going to
affect very much what i buy
but with food all i have is a built-in
thing in the brain that does half the
marketer's job
that makes me hungry and i constantly
have to find new food
to fill that gap and marketers can
compete basically through
differentiation in their brands
to get me to buy it i want you to
compare this to tech real quick
i want you to imagine that you are a
rich gamer like the kind of gamer
everyone makes fun of on pcmr
let's say you're the type of person that
buys a brand new 30 90 or 30 90
equivalent every three years
at retail price okay so you must be
really hardcore you are a small
percentage population so that means on
average you're going to spend 500
a year on graphics card that's what i
would try to capture as a marketer let
me compare that
to how much the average person spends
eating out
this is the hour this is everybody this
is every single person in america
spends about three grand a year eating
out so
in terms of amount of money at play here
for marketers to capture
it there's no comparison food is the
dominant industry
so you can see like every one of these
chips
solves the same consumer need you want a
chip to snack on
you got the munchies how do they stand
out marketing
okay so they're in a constant fight over
tiny percentages of market share
and that's why tech companies will often
hire people who used to work in these
industries and marketing
because they're the most experienced
they've been in battle the most all
marketers do is eat hot chip and lie
if you think that you choose food based
solely on taste
you are lying you are you are lying to
me
you are that's that's major major cap
okay there have been many many studies
uh that show that how a food appears uh
directly influences how you rate it how
you think it tasted so this is the test
i wanna talk about
people taste tested these two wines okay
they described the one on the left as
light airy hints of passion fruit banana
minerals a little bit of flint they said
the right one was rich
full body a deep taste
it was the same wine with food coloring
and this study was repeated the real
takeaway from this
is that our brains are completely
scrambled up
with with the senses it all overlaps
memory taste touch sight
scent it all is just
together in there
and there's no way of untangling it and
so when we think we're only isolating
based on taste
we're really using a variety of things
to try and create a picture in our minds
and that is what marketers take
advantage of uh let me talk about some
other companies
that have uh done some little tricky
secrets
uh to get your dollar for example one of
the main things they'll do is they will
rename products
that have been named the same way for
thousands of years in an attempt to make
you think it's something new
and sell it for a higher price for a
great example
is the rockfish the rockfish was a fish
that's been around forever and sold for
ten dollars a pound
relatively recently they rebranded it as
the red snapper
and they now sell it for twenty four
dollars a pound it's the same fish
i mean taco bell does this on the reg
because taco bell literally has the same
five ingredients
they don't change the ingredients they
send to the stores
they just re shuffle them around in
different ways call it something new
know you are lying to me truck i choose
to eat only the crunchiest of mommy's
tendees
to imply that i a youtube frog could
ever be influenced by
marketing is pure insanity and i resent
the implication
obviously i was talking about everybody
but you you're a sigma male
you're outside of the system marketers
can't touch you and that is why you're
the king that is why you only accept the
finest attendees
of course uh but the most sneaky one the
one i want to talk about the most the
most sneaky
is for a long long long time we just
didn't give a about health we
you know i mean people smoke four packs
a day they ate a steak and a gallon of
milk and then went to bed all right
people didn't give a and then
everyone got really
really really obese and they became kind
of a problem
and so in recent years you know we've
slowly started to say hey
we should probably eat less sugar and so
a big one that's been happening is that
people are afraid of high fructose corn
syrup
they'll look at the box and see if it
has high fructose corn syrup if it does
they're afraid to buy it
so what they've been doing this is only
one of many many names
is they have legally found almost
any other name they could put on the
label other than high fructose corn
syrup
i've found 10 they'll call it fructose
isolate
fructose syrup maize syrup they'll use
the indian name for corn
and call it maize syrup they'll call it
iso glucose this is a good one because
it's you don't know what the that
is isoglucose
they want to include fruit in there
because fruit sounds healthy
they'll call it fruit fructose
they'll call it hfcs for short
especially if they have a small package
they'll just shorten to hfcs so you
don't know what the that is
they'll call it crystalline fructose
they have about 10 different names
they'll do other than this one because
they don't want you to
find out that it's basically all the
same thing and you know it's unhealthy
for you
this one is an intriguing example that i
thought was funny of what marketers have
done
so in australia in 2004
there was a locust plague and the
government was like
we have all these locusts and of course
everyone hates and despises locusts
what if we can get people to eat them
and so they came up with this plan to
call locust
sky prawns
[Laughter]
the government of australia spent
millions of dollars on an ad campaign
to turn locusts into sky prawns
they launched a book called cooking with
sky prawns
that had 20 recipes and tried to drive
up the demand
now unfortunately i did my reach i
couldn't find out how successful this
was
but if you're still enjoying sky prawns
in australia i got some bad news for you
about the source
of those tasty delicious luxury treats
the dolphin fish
this is a perfectly innocuous name and
in fact this fish has nothing to do with
dolphins
but consumers were concerned that they
were somehow harming dolphins when they
ate it
it had nothing to do with dolphins but
they were like well i don't want to be
i don't want to kill a dolphin for this
fish if you think about it for two
seconds you realize you're not killing a
dolphin but
the fact that dolphin was in the name
was insurmountable so they changed to
mahi mahi and again
sales skyrocketed through the roof again
it's not just
taste marketers have quickly realized
it's not taste
how things are presented is the
difference between billions of dollars
revenue and nothing
it's not just naming it's also visuals
if there's one thing i've learned from
food marketing it's how important
visuals are
food marketers understand this better
than any other field because you're
already going to be hungry
okay the interest is already built into
our our bodies it needs to look good
and having it look good is so important
and i am not qualified to talk about
this
okay you know who's qualified to talk
about this
today's special guest
author entrepreneur crypto investor
and relatable gen z burger hey hey hey
hey guys hey it's me perksy
this is my social earlier where i said
sun's out buns out and obviously like i
got a ton of engagement but not
like not a lot i almost considered
deleting it and it got me thinking about
like all the pressure there is from all
these like glossy burgers
in the fast food magazines to look good
and it really puts a toll on your mental
like i've been working out but like i
still feel like i'm not
good enough i don't know if you guys can
relate or whatever
so i thought i'd give a talk about some
of the tricks of the trade
that turned like a burger that looks
like this
into a burger that looks
like this you know what i'm saying
people want what they cracked up to be
on social media you know what i'm saying
like you get these burgers in real life
and they're
they're all talk they're all online
twitter fingers you know
this burger looks pretty delicious right
i think that looks pretty tasty
it's kind of a thirst trap one of the
first tricks marketers will do
is it's drastically undercooked
that's how they keep it plump so once
you cook a burger it shrinks a little
bit
and so uh they'll make it raw
basically nearly raw but if it's if it's
raw how does it look
grilled how do they get these grill
lines like look at those beautiful
sultry grill lines god damn you know
like
sheesh you know what i'm saying i see
those grill lines
i'm gonna do something bad the truth is
they're fake yeah they're not really
from a grill
they just adam it's just basically a raw
burger a near raw burger
and they add the grill marks fake uh oh
shoe polish yeah
they'll just basically paint shoe polish
onto the line the grill marks to make
them pop
so basically when you see a food a
burger in an ad it's a raw
painted on burger covered in wax and
shoe polish
it looks good but that's not how food's
eaten am i right
you know we all be a little more
authentic on social a little more real
the trend for this has gotten so bad
marketers basically noticed
that if you add grill marks it sells
better
and so now often frozen
food is delivered to grocery stores
with grill marks painted on
so when you buy this has never touched
heat in its life but that is a frozen
cut of chicken
with grill marks painted on and you can
buy this at a grocery store
it's literally frozen anyway one
one more thing that um i thought was
interesting
because you know i'm a big fan of cereal
hreg loves golden graham so he's always
eating cereal so i'll join him
and in fact he might be eating some
right now off camera
because like the picture on the right is
what it looks like when i make cereal
but the picture on the left is like what
it looks like in all the ads and i'm
like why doesn't mine look like that
and it's because that's literally glue
like not even a joke
like most pictures of cereal you see on
boxes
literally it's filled with glue and it
helps the
food stick in the right spot for
photography
and it looks like it has more of a shine
and a pop anyway
that's sort of my psa i don't want to
take too much of your time and i get a
little nervous in front of
crowds like this i don't know if you can
relate so i'm going to give it back to
atroc
um and i just want you guys to
if you really like my content you know
please consider subscribing to hroc
because i get all the money
oh also one more thing if you are
feeling depressed
consider buying like a value meal
because the great value
from a place like mcdonald's or burger
king
will make you feel a lot better can we
give it up for bergsy
holy moly despite being
you know a youthful gen z burger he
still did a fantastic job on camera
i i guess it was decided long ago
that that the idea of fruit is healthy
and so anytime they can add the word
fruit to anything
they will do it and so one of the big
ones that you hear a lot
is made with real fruit
that essentially means this is
candy
if you see made with real fruit assume
that this is candy
fruit roll-ups is candy when you look at
the ingredients it's very obvious that
it's mostly just sugar
but if they add even like a drop of
fruit juice they can call it
made with real fruit there's nothing
healthy about it another one is
grass-fed
they'll make up these phrases that have
no enforcement
the usda does not enforce these phrases
okay so you can make it up the first 10
months of a cow's life
they're almost all fed grass and they're
transitioned to grain
and so as long as they've eaten grass at
one point in their life
they can say safely that it was
grass-fed
all you have to do is give them grass
once this
is most likely a grass-fed cow they had
some grass when they were small and now
they're in like this factory problem but
they don't put this on the packaging
they put this image to kind of distract
you
this one's for like real california
types
they'll say non-gmo i barely know what
that means essentially almost nothing
is non-gmo at this point and the fda has
publicly stated
that it will not it will it was innocent
specifically
it will not enforce any standards on
non-gmo labeling
so companies will just slap it on
anything that's not selling and
hopefully
it'll prove sales another one back on
fruit
is this one where they say a hundred
percent
juice now a hundred percent juice is
very interesting
because fruit juices are generally
delicious
but they're also expensive and so to
save money what companies will do
is include a bunch of cheap like
white grape juice
unfinished pear extract like a bunch of
things and what they end up with
something that's a hundred percent
juice it's not the juice you bought
if you buy a uh you know like a bottle
of apple juice you're not getting a
bottle of apple juice you're getting
some apple juice and a lot of like
grape juice white grape juice but it's
100 juice
the only place you're going to get 100
juice is xrc's stream
by the way his music video if you
haven't seen it is absolutely fire
free range doesn't mean anything it's
not defined
and the amount like if it's called
free-range chicken
there is no defined time for how long
that chicken needs to have been on free
range
it can literally be four minutes so free
range means nothing
and then fda approved is like
you pretty much can't sell food unless
it's fda approved
but apparently it makes consumers think
it's safer they'll just put like that's
like
saying exists you're increasing the
vegan i'm not vegan at all i
literally my food pyramid if i were to
draw it let me i'll make it for you
right now okay
this is my food pyramid let's get a box
of these
at the top and then let's get
a chipotle steak burrito
and that is what it takes to be a god
gamer if you guys want to know the diet
basically it's four parts chipotle steak
burrito one part golden grams
but i'm also not stupid i know that most
of the things i eat
when i don't pay attention are unhealthy
and i'm also very aware that i'm getting
um
marketed to when i see all that stuff in
the box but when i first noticed it was
actually
uh quite a few years back when i worked
at twitch i added this addiction to
pop-tarts i would eat pop-tarts for
breakfast i don't know i didn't think
they were healthy but i didn't think
they were bad
i remember going to the store and i was
like
all right pop-tarts are bad let me get a
better option all right now i've learned
the truth pop tarts are too
sugary it's dessert basically this
opened my i was like oh damn this is
literally a jolly rancher pop-tart
of course this is candy i don't
i'm not gonna eat this and then i was
like wait a minute there's a healthy
option
there's nature's path organic
generations
look at this farm it's razzy raspberry
raspberry is a fruit
holy this is the healthy option
finally i can have my
my cake and eat it too it's non-gmo
certified and then i looked at the label
and a lot of you are spamming same
same same bro it's worse than
that
this is the pop-tart one this is the
jolly rancher pop-tart
16 grams of sugar that's a lot that's
jolly rancher pop-tarts this is the usda
vegetarian all-natural gmo organic
18 bro it was worse for you
it was more unhealthy than jolly rancher
pop tarts
it also cost more and there was less in
the pack
it was a complete scam and that's why i
stick to my tried and true chipotle
steak burrito
but i found a quick video it's from penn
teller it's kind of a while ago
but it's basically about how our taste
can be skewed anyway this is penn
teller's water bottle taste test what
was the actual source of these chic
waters
a garden hose on the restaurant patio
it has a flavor to it how would you
compare it to tap water
oh yeah definitely better than tap water
it doesn't have an apple
it's got it's got a flavor that it
almost feels like
a beverage oven water but without
sugar or any additives hello to robin a
pass the taste test it does feel glacier
glacier this is good
that's good this one i don't i don't
taste the minerals so much i said sir
well
maybe it was time to let the diners know
just what they've been drinking oh they
tell them now what would you think if i
told you that all of these waters came
from the same garden hose
that's so mean that's so rude ah
[Music]
that's so embarrassing after you just
spent all that time
you shouldn't tell him bro that's so
that's so
 problem face
i'm gonna kill you see me
outside yeah that's what he's thinking
bro
i'm a water hook so keep that in mind
next time you assume your taste buds are
up to the task
although i'll be honest with you so i've
seen that video and i
um ari my fiance always talks about
how she really can taste the difference
in waters all right and i was like
no you can't it's marketing you can't
and i was like i was i was getting mad
at her i was like babe
i'm sorry to break it to you babe you
can't you
can't and uh so i concocted a taste test
i did different bottles and tap water
and i put them all different cups
and i labeled them and i tested it with
her and
not only did she get all of them right
but i got mad that she was getting him
right
so i cheated i cheated and i i
changed the label just so i could get
her just like a get one over on her
because she was like being so smug
about how she got it and i cheated and
then
she knew i cheated she wasn't even like
oh oh i guess i was wrong she was like
no
i'm 100 certain this is dasani or
whatever
and i was like i was like no babe look
at the label and she was like
she's like i know this is wrong
and i had to break down and tell her i
was like how the
so literally i don't know if it's her or
what but she was able i couldn't do it
i literally couldn't do it but i i will
say some people can a hundred percent
already can
that was our edition of marketing monday
uh food marketing edition featuring

oh
How Coca-Cola lost 3 billion dollars in 5 seconds - YouTube
let's start with wins and fails we
always open every marketing monday
session with some marketing wins and
fails from the past
uh in this case two weeks i'd like to
give a huge
win to coca-cola
and you're gonna say what you're gonna
say why
uh over the past i think five days ago
cristiano ronaldo the world's most
famous
football player had a clip where
he um coca-cola is a sponsor
of uh the euro 2020 soccer cup
and it was required that during all
interviews two bottles of coke
be placed on the stage next people as
they're being interviewed
cristiano ronaldo did not give a single
[ __ ]
so he got there he picked up both
bottles
put him away off screen and then said
drink water
and immediately coke stock price lost
five billion dollars in value
and of course everyone wrote four
million articles about it oh my god oh
my god
it is a testament to the power of uh
celebrity and creators which has only
gotten more powerful every year
i believe it was kylie jenner who
knocked 15 billion dollars off of uh
snapchat's market cap overnight by
tweeting she has new snapchat anymore
that being said this is a complete
non-starter this story is dead
i mean it was it was only funny for a
day it died after a day
and i think a large part of it was due
to coke's great response coke actually
has a seasoned pr team that knows how to
play this [ __ ] down really quickly
but coke's response which was yeah
they had a very quick response that said
yeah this is their
their share place plump plummeted from
56
18 to 55 44.
like less than a full euro coke
destroyed
oh pepsi generation this meant nothing
okay
uh but coke said instead of like
doubling down or getting angry or trying
to change things
they literally just said everyone is
entitled to their drink preferences
everyone has different tastes and needs
players are offered water and coke and
coke zero sugar
that's it and then it became not a story
anymore because coke wasn't mad or angry
no one really cared
and it faded instantly and it was just
smart
and so many people think of how dream
might have handled this
you know what i'm saying this is a very
smart
seasoned pr strategy to just get it away
to just be like yep fine and then and
move on which is it takes discipline
and cocoa has that they're one of the
most experienced marketing organizations
in the world
but it's impressive to see because this
could have been a bigger story for
longer and it just simply wasn't it was
forgotten about by the next day
so that's a win for coke i was impressed
uh that's that's a win
let me give you a fail though the fail
is every single one of you
[ __ ] who told me i was wrong about
dogecoin
dogecoin continues a weeks-long slide
with a massive fall today but i i took a
screenshot that i really really liked
that really just made me think of
someone
who had been talking [ __ ] in my chat
this is
a guy called slum doge millionaire
who said down almost 200 000 dollars in
one single days
today with dogecoin guess who's still
not selling
diamond hands doge army doge hey keep it
up king hold
hold you broke bastard hold it's a
cult it literally is preying on people
who see a chance to get rich quick there
is this was
inevitable from minute one bitcoin and
ethereum are the only ones that even
have a chance
of long-term success everything else i
swear to god you're being scammed bro
and that's that's all i can tell you and
if you don't want to hear me that's fine
but
the numbers will out over time you have
a safe moon story conor what's your
statement story
in miami there was this high as [ __ ] guy
outside of a club
and hassan and i were waiting the guy
asked us for a photo saying he
recognized us
and then he offhandedly said oh yeah i
made safe moon
that's your king that is your king safe
mooners
now i mean obviously there is one coin
that only just prints value
and that of course is stan's coin
stands coin nearing five dollars in
value
destroying uh dogecoin and in fact if
you want to protect your family's
interest in earnings for generations
if you want your kids your grandkids and
their grandkids
to live in mansions you put your money
in stance coin but everything else
is an absolute joke a charlatan of a
coin
down that means you buy the dip if
stan's coin is down that's a buying
opportunity
uh okay so that was my fail my
second win is the following i
spoke about in my marketing money
predictions way back in january
uh just about the rise of influencers
and i know that it's been a long time
coming but i just mean
i think we're really starting to see
within the past year or two that the
democratization of the internet
into all these different hyper niches
create
sort of micro celebrities with still
massive massive value because they can
capture attention
in ways that tv no longer can and so i
want to show you an example that just
kind of stunned me and that is this
it was announced today there is now a 10
million dollar
contract with a brand to sponsor
paul macbeth the 31 year old
disc golf celebrity and it's because
there's a
there's a a passionate group of fans
that love disc golf
and he's a celebrity among them and
that's worth it turns out a staggering
amount of money in an age where tv is
less and less valuable
and traditional ads are less and less
valuable uh and so creators are getting
more and more
more power with brands it's it's a it's
a trend that is not slowing at all it's
going to get bigger next year and year
after that
disc golf manufacturer discraft
announced an endorsement deal
because literally okay look he's not
going to be the [ __ ] face of
gucci right he's not a generalized
celebrity
but it doesn't matter anymore he's a
micro celebrity to people that buy disc
golf stuff
and so a disc golf manufacturer will pay
him almost any amount of money
because they target the exact market
they want it's it's a win for both
and so uh i just wanted to say massive
dub to this guy
who literally would you know was
probably the biggest
uh disc golf playing nerd in college and
is now
driving a mclaren spider off of that
frisbee throw it's insane
so uh dubbed him that's a dub oh a fail
the fail is
our good friends at sony
but uh sony insists
it really likes crossplay now honest
and this is likely a direct response to
a great showing by xbox
sustained public pressure and a leak
during the epic games trial that showed
that they really do not like cross-play
at all
they openly fight it they hate it they
don't want it to happen
and now they are finally insisting no we
love it
it's great and what that means is
we will do it right up until we don't
need to
microsoft is offering one of the best
value deals of all time
with um the game pass and uh sony is
gonna have to answer suit with uh
with cross play and a lot of things
people are demanding when there's a
great competition customers win so it's
gonna be good for
all of us gamers until one side pulls
ahead and then it's gonna be bad again
but fanboys will be happy so you know
either way there's a win
um okay and then finally i actually had
one more fail one more fail
um oh and that was this is not really
marketing related at all
but i was browsing stanz's discord
to see if actually someone had mentioned
that they were talking about the
cheating thing
so i went to check it and i i was just
browsing it
and then uh this guy said
so many logic like i i went to
elementary school and did a lot of logic
puzzles like these and he just linked
the random logic puzzle
and then i kept scrolling and then this
guy said
blue this is yesterday boom shakalaka
and he posted this
and i was looking at it and i was like
wait this is wrong
[Laughter]
you said boom shakalaka but you did it
wrong
and so a day later i tagged him
in my first post i think in stanza's
discord ever
i tagged him and said this is wrong
and he said dog what the [ __ ] you
scrolled all the way up to that message
and figure it out yourself cause i'm
stumped and so i instantly responded
because i had already done it with this
and i had already done it and then i
said
lmao okay bye and i didn't post anything
else
and i just wanted to drop that dub you
know more of an
l for this guy you don't say boom shock
a lock unless you're sure you've got it
so just be careful if you're going to
drop boom shot glock on logic puzzles
i want i am like batman i have to police
that [ __ ] okay
i don't care where it is where i find it
i like logic puzzles too
and that's our final uh win and fail
quite a win
uh yeah i can just do a q a we'll just
close with a q a do you think that as
esports grows will any video game
providers
provide players with modern sports also
level contracts
yes esports will eventually have
contracts as big as real sports now
do i think that anyone will ever make
that much money playing nba 2k
or something no i don't because those
nobody wants to watch the suns versus
the spurs
in nba 2k real sports are literally just
a better version
there is no real version of valerian
people want to watch valorem
and by the way like fortnight in 2018
was a huge phenomenon
and had massive prize pools that is the
beginning there will be a hunt there
will be something 10x bigger than
fortnite
you ever lost your inspiration
motivation for marketing yeah of course
bro when i was working at twitch and i
had to [ __ ] proofread emails
when my boomer boss's boss made me print
out emails
print them out and take a red marker and
go through and proofread them
before we could [ __ ] upload them to
our server
i i was like this what am i doing yeah
yeah before he did
the old cmo yeah he was a [ __ ]
nightmare
did you go to a good university i went
to the best university arizona state
university
the harvard of the southwest it's so
exclusionary they only accept
98.6 percent of applicants okay
that is exclusionary that is the [ __ ]
that's the vip of the vip
do you think ford will ever collab with
epic games to make fortnite
brother you've got a future in marketing
epic games hire this man
holy [ __ ] you just killed truck month
forget truck month here comes ford night
three years
late thoughts on costco keeping the
price
of its hot dogs low even though it's a
loss leader
costco keeps the hot dogs low i think
there was a funny quote where the guy's
like what did he say i think
i'll [ __ ] kill you if you raise the
hot dog prices or what
yeah yeah costco's founder told the
company's current ceo
if you raise the price of the [ __ ]
hot dog i will kill you
[Laughter]
yeah type he told the ceo that and of
course it's smart
because the hot dog is cheap and a great
value so it gets you in the door and
then you spend a lot of money on other
things
they make the money back if you just
showed up at costco for the hot dog
technically you won hey big a just be
radiant
uh nightmare king grim one let me know
you inspired me to do radiant
uh hall of the gods oh awesome
hell yeah dude [ __ ] yeah congrats i bet
that was really satisfying to beat i
think once
once you do it it feels [ __ ] good huh
oh but you might have cheated though
the thing is i didn't see you do it
so i'm gonna write an eight page letter
that you cheated because now that i've
done it
i have now become a difficulty andy so
first of
all there's no way you could have done
it because i did it
and i feel too good about it so if you
did it then it takes away my value
so you must have cheated and uh we all
know it
shame on you absolutely shame on you
are your 30s actually your prime can't
ask me i'm biased i just turned 30 bro
yeah i'm not going to say no you're over
the [ __ ] hill
yeah i think 30s are your prime but i'm
[ __ ] tom brady would say 40s bro
my theory is that uh more important than
age is health
i know some [ __ ] 22 year olds that
are so [ __ ] unhealthy
they they live their life like they're
[ __ ] 40 dude
i actually i i have the number one word
i actually think this is the biggest
advice i can give most people
i think one of the biggest predictors
i've seen of success
with the people that i've met like in
esports who went on to do awesome [ __ ]
is energy if they got energy
it it it almost seems to work out do you
know what i'm saying
and energy is usually a function of like
health like if you're healthy
you get a good amount of sleep you have
a lot more energy and people want to be
around you more and
low energy just sucks circumstances but
i i would say for most people that i
know
especially people that are like 18 to 24
my average demographic
and thinking about myself in 1824 what
you probably need bro is a good night's
sleep
try getting good at sleep two nights in
a row and just see how you [ __ ] feel
you're gonna feel [ __ ] amazing but i
didn't do it either so i don't know i
can't i can't tell you to do what i
didn't do i stayed up late in grinded
league
These 3 Lines Explain All of Marketing - YouTube
welcome to marketing monday today's
topic
the three lines theory of marketing
let me give you some background let me
give you some context three weeks ago
i decided to expand my professional
career
and so i signed up for what is known as
a brand
strategy sprint a three-week intensive
version
of the senior level mba
brand strategy course at nyu stern
now if you'll know i spend my work hours
working
i spend my after work hours streaming or
grinding hollow knight
[Music]
god so it actually did not leave me a
lot of time
to study for this class in order to help
myself learn the material
for an upcoming final project i'm going
to teach it to you
now i want to give full credit to
section 4
the education company that created this
these concepts are originally from them
i'm reteaching them
in my own words and and with you know my
own examples and stuff but
it is essentially their stuff and if any
of you become marketing professionals be
sure to check them out
when you hear the word branding as a
marketer or someone who's gonna have a
business or even think about your own
personal brand
you should think about the word margin
brand should just be a fancy word for
the word
margin okay so let me start with the
three lines and then we'll explain what
that is
line one the red line
cost line two
price the final line this is the most
important line
for a marketer is perceived value
which has to be above price and these
three lines
explain all aspects of marketing now
the difference between cost and price
is called margin okay
that's how much you make what's
important about the three lines theory
is that the lines can never cross
price can never go above this if the
perceived value is what the
is what the customer thinks of your
product customers will only
buy something if they think they're
getting more value than what it costs
now let's say let's say my margin right
now let's say it's 50 cents
and this is a dollar okay so i'm making
50 cents right here
i'll make a box for you this is my juicy
margin box
all right i want it to be bigger
well if perceived value is right here i
can't because i can't raise prices i
don't have any room
so your goal as a marketer is to raise
this
the higher you get this the higher you
can raise this
and then you can get fat margins okay
now the second part of this is market
share
the difference between price and
perceived value and it means more people
are buying it's about the number of
people buying it okay
if you want a huge market share you can
raise your perceived value really high
and keep prices low okay
for example think about netflix
perfect example netflix could charge
more they would get fewer customers
would probably make more money they'd
have a bigger margin
they don't because they want a bigger
market share they want a lot of people
using it
either way you either get a lot of
people using it or you get a lot of
margin which is a lot of money
those are your two options so your
marketer's goal is people think they're
getting more
that is that is the crux of brand that
is the essential story of brand
uh we could just watch this movie or we
can go more in depth on the brands i'm
gonna do ford versus ferrari
to explain the difference in strategies
with perceived value with the three
lines
in 2019 ford sold
5.4 million cars ferrari sold
about 10 000 actually about like seven
or eight thousand cars
that's it in the whole year and you'd
think wow
one company is just significantly doing
better than the other
there's just no other way to slice it
but
margin wise ford takes about
eight to ten thousand dollars of plastic
and steel and computer parts and makes a
car
and sells it for about eight percent
more than it costs to make
ferrari 52 percent six times more
gross margin okay so ferrari makes a
fat chunk of cash on every car sold and
that's all from the brand
that is purely from the brand it costs
them you know a certain amount of money
to make the car and they
sell it for a lot more than it costs to
make so they have
a gigantic margin but pretty low market
share
few cars sold but a huge amount of price
while ford they have uh
a lot amount of cars sold huge market
share but very little margin okay
but in the end it's all they're both
trying to raise this perceived value so
they can increase their strategy there's
two different strategies
ford's goal is to raise that blue line
through advertising that's why they
spend the most of any car maker
ford spent 3.6 billion dollars on
advertising
that's way more than mercedes-benz uh
and ferrari and tesla
spent zero okay the average age of their
buyer
is 41 years old relatively young for a
car buyer
and has an average salary about 80
thousand dollars okay
ford is targeting essentially the
everyman they spend a ton of money on
ads
and that is why they are the official
truck of the nfl they spend about 40
million dollars a year
to be the official truck of the nfl
that's why you see so many goddamn truck
commercials during the nfl
because it targets this guy exactly
the 41 year old middle of the road
american all right
that's what they're going for get great
deals on ford f-series america's
best-selling trucks for 43 years
like a total savings of 12 691 on the
billboard tough f-150
only now look at this this is exactly
what we're talking about
their strategy is one of the original
the easiest most basic but core
marketing strategies and the idea of
more for less
the idea is literally to show you
how much you're getting at an affordable
price
that is entirely different from how
ferrari
raises their um blue line raises their
perceived value
ferrari literally limits car sales this
is an actual article that i found
ferrari actually on purpose stop
selling cars so they can have high
perceived value
if they get too many somebody said
conor said some dude sat in a board room
and said let's say it's truck month and
it worked
it did whoever came up with truck month
is actually a genius
truck month isn't even a consistent
month you're right they just do truck
month whenever they want you to sell
more trucks
technically all months at ford are truck
month because they sell trucks every
month
but ferrari doesn't do that ferrari
limits their sales they try to keep
a few amount of cars going out because
if there's too many ferraris if their
market share gets too big
they lose the exclusive value of their
brand they lose their perceived value
and they can't charge as high prices
if everyone's got a ferrari then you're
not going to pay a huge amount of money
for it
this is the strategy behind things like
drops exclusive sneakers
nfts a lot of things a lot of things in
in the modern day economy are using the
strategy of scarcity
to get artificially increased their
perceived value human beings generally
think
that things that are scarce are
worthwhile
and so you can spend a lot less on
advertising in fact
i don't know if you saw on this ferrari
spends nothing
now this is on tv ads ferrari spends
money on like
formula one sponsorships and major race
influencers and
designing uh custom super cars that can
be shown off at auto shows but they
spend no money on tv ads at all ferrari
spends zero
ferrari goes for um
high-end high-performance luxury
italian foreign
limited vehicles and it shows in the
amount of dealerships so look at this
this is number of dealerships for every
ferrari dealership
there is 104 dealerships and they
attract a different buyer
so i mentioned that this is the average
age
of ford users does anyone want to guess
what the average age of
a ferrari user is who do you think is
buying this car
the answer is a 51 year old millionaire
ferrari despite a brand that
seems to appeal to uh the youth and have
luxury
is mostly bought with people with
mid-life crisis
who have a lot of money the average
ferrari owner owns
five other cars that's a crazy stat
ford does advertising gets his number up
once they get this number up
they do not raise price and if you have
a big
uh market share here you could do
something called economies of scale this
is one of your benefits
so if you're making a gazillion cars
you can use large factories to lower
your cost you can lower your cost
and that way you're getting margin two
so now they're making a little bit more
money and they're selling a ton of cars
that's how ford does it okay
ferrari on the other hand they raise
their perceived value super high
and then they raise their price right up
on the ass of that
so they just get a ton of money per car
it's not as big of a business but it
creates them
a ton of money for significantly less
work they don't have to have so many
employees they don't have to have so
many factories
the risk is lower as long as they keep
the brand value high
they just make an absolute rack load of
money
per car and if you look around the at
any brand you'll see in your life you
can start to see how they all tackle
this problem in different ways
a great example of a company that is the
best in the world
is apple because apple has an incredibly
low cost product
they have raised the perceived value so
high let me see if i can do this
that they they get both they get
the uh sales numbers of ford
and the margin of ferrari they make as
much money per phone as like a ferrari
would on their car and percentage-wise
but they sell as many phones as a ford
would sell cars
it is unique there is no there's no
product like the iphone
that sells as many as it does and still
has the high perceived value
how do monopoly sustain themselves
against companies with lower prices
so for example you're thinking of maybe
um uber or
or microsoft right now with xbox game
pass
where they're they they price it
underneath what it costs to make
what uber does is they get a bunch of
investor money
so rich people invest billions into uber
and then uber spends that money
on offering things under their cost
let's be honest here's the truth of the
matter
the average person did not have the
ability to have a private chauffeur
anywhere they wanted to go okay and now
suddenly since 2014 we have
the reason for that is because it's
artificially lowered
it's not gonna last forever and you've
already seen it uber prices have been
going up a lot recently
because they're burning money it just it
can't be sold for that cheaply
but they wanted market share they want
everyone to know their name and it
worked they got a big brand
and the plan is once you get everyone
hooked on uber
you raise the price back up you've
killed taxis a lot of cities don't even
have tax service anymore you've killed
all the competition
and then you that's how you do you
outlast your competition you lower the
price
outlast competition and then raise price
that is the monopoly strategy
what the really scary monopolies like
amazon do
is they keep these prices low so you
never suspect them of a monopoly
like in the 1920s or 30s they would do
this they would lower the price
drive competitors out of business and
then raise them back up and everyone get
pissed
what amazon does they lower the prices
they keep them low
and then they just use their dominant
market share to win
other things so for example um they want
to win
versus netflix they can now use the fact
that amazon is the biggest
shopping service in the world to bundle
it with prime to make prime video bigger
plenty of people in the chat would see a
gucci belt at like 100 bucks and be like
what the [ __ ]
why the [ __ ] would i pay that much money
for a belt because for you the perceived
value is lower than that price
for some people that's like oh [ __ ] 100
bucks for a gucci bell that's a deal
but for the same people you might be
like oh my god a new valerian skin
for only 20 bucks what a [ __ ] deal
i'll never buy gucci but i'll buy this
knife skin
okay you all fall for the same tricks
you have different preferences okay
what's especially amazing about digital
goods is the cost is
almost nothing the cost is so far down
here
so if they can price it like at 20 bucks
if they can get the blue line up to
where you think that's worth something
they are making racks and again this
applies to every company if you think
about every company you can figure out
what
how what is their strategy where is
their lines at what they're trying to do
it's a great way to think about
marketing in general and i hope
that this breakdown uh has opened some
thoughts for you and helped you think
about it my final example
is when you go too far with that is uh
is is moviepass all right
so moviepass had a pretty decent
perceived value it cost
an absolute [ __ ] ton to make probably
right up here
and they priced it way down here
they priced it so much lower than what
you were getting than what it cost them
they were essentially giving you free
movie tickets for 10 bucks a month you
could watch as many movies you want
and all they were doing is buying those
tickets from the movie theater and
giving them to you
it was an amazing deal and that's why
they were able to attract a ton of
customers in no time
they did they did almost no marketing
but of course
that doesn't work for very long they
were they were losing so much money on
each movie
that the weekend that that that the
mission impossible three came out
mystery possible fallout whenever that
movie came out whenever fallout came out
some of you went to go see it that it
bankrupted the company the best thing
you can do
to grow whatever you're trying to do is
raise this
so i think i've covered it i hope this
helped this to me is a fascinating
subject i know
it's a little it's actually one of my
most intense marketing streams
not too many jokes but i uh i i
i think it's a good framework and now i
can like use that to build off a lot of
things i want to talk about
Brands Getting Roasted - YouTube
welcome welcome to marketing monday the
greatest and only marketing show on
twitch and youtube
last week we did a kind of really
in-depth scholastic marketing monday
this one's a little more fun doing
something that everybody loves doing in
marketing and that's dunking on stupid
brands
dunking on stupid brands i found a
twitter account called brands getting
owned and we're gonna go through it and
laugh bp tweeted the first step the
first step to reducing your emissions is
to know where you stand
find out your hashtag carpet footprint
with our new calculator and share your
pledge today and then andrew here said i
pledge at the spill 4.9 million barrels
of oil into the gulf of mexico
which is a fire dunk and a fire comeback
just to talk about it a little more
bp has um if anything
wasted just as much money
on pr consultants after the spill as
they lost in the spill
they've tried so many
things
to to
re-brand their image there is no getting
around it you had a massive oil spill
that everybody remembers stop paying all
these [ __ ] companies
to do stupid gimmicky that's not going
to change your image
it's ridiculous
this one says i'm loving it
this is a food bank now workers seized a
mcdonald's in france
okay
not exactly a food bank it's a stolen
mcdonald's
we can't just have every person who's
food insecure
sees a mcdonald's that's not we need a
better solution than that it's a good
start
uh
but
you know the really sad part is that
none of these workers got any ice cream
us weekly tweeted free britney
and then someone found the receipts
caught in 4k of us weekly
calling britney a time bomb britney out
of control
why pop's former good girl is suddenly
so bad sick mental illness signs worsen
yeah the more i've heard about this and
i'm not the expert by any means mostly
her [ __ ] psychotic dad who has been
siphoning all of their money
like he pays himself like a 16k a month
salary on top of bonuses out of her
profits
controls her friend's circle so she
can't hang out with anybody
stops her from having
children in relationships because they
might ruin the performance and then just
forces her to work in vegas so we can
make money it's insane it's he literally
controls her whole life and he has a
legal conservatorship so he can do it
she's kind of trapped
okay listen this whole video can't just
be me dunking on brands i'm a marketer
that hurts my heart so let me see
something nice about a brand that i do
like
and that of course is our first
returning sponsor to marketing monday
dr squatch so okay i've been using these
bars they sent me a care package a few
months ago for the first go around and
ever since then i've been buying my own
bars because it passes three tests okay
the ingredients are natural they smell
good and ari likes it that's the
important part my fiance likes it
here's proof okay try smelling them me
so to add a little positivity this
episode i decided to write them a nice
tweet
dr squash soap go thank you for
sponsoring marketing monday i love the
soap ps the new deodorant is great too
let's add a little video
of me looking like an absolute chat with
their new deodorant
really slathering it on as a gamer
should
if any of that interests you
new customers can get 20 off on orders
of 20 or more when they go to
doctorsquatch.com and enter code dsc
atriac click the link in the description
below
back to the video how likely are you to
recommend windows 10 to a friend or
colleague not at all likely please
explain why you gave this score i need
you to understand that people don't have
conversations where they randomly
recommend operations to one another
you haven't been to silicon valley then
because i guarantee half the engineers
at twitch are talking about
linux versus
mac versus
all the time
it's nerdy as [ __ ] but they do it
um
oh my god dude
the ice government pride month post
[ __ ] ice is tweeting about
that's what we needed
that's what we needed thank god
i was worried for all our all our allies
in the lgbtq community but now now that
ice is on their side nothing will stop
them yeah anyway this is the the
response a trans woman died in ice
custody then isolated video footage yeah
i mean this is an extreme
dark example
but i could talk a little bit about
pride
as a post concept it
it um from brands and from government
agencies like ice
it just feels so inauthentic and that's
people dunk on it so much there i don't
usually talk about this because
um
first of all i'm pro the cause
and second of all there is a benefit
even if it's cringy of a lot of big
corporations doing it to where it's like
okay
even if you're an opponent it's like oh
it's just so normal that it brings it to
the mainstream so there is a benefit but
as an on individual level
the posts themselves are so cringy
because they're so
so so so
transparent
you know
your self-interest is so transparent and
no one believes that ice is a strong
pride ally
are billboards actually worth it it's so
weird i just i literally
i'm not kidding i'm gonna drag this over
for my second monitor
this is an article on billboard history
i was that's what i read for fun i was
halfway through this when i started
streaming
that's crazy yeah i was reading about
the history of billboards and marketing
and because i had the same question i
was like are billboards still worth it
like does do are billboards undervalued
could you make
and uh so i was reading about that's so
funny you asked yeah and i found this
i'll just share it with you right now i
was actually gonna
but it's probably not big enough for a
marketing monday so i'm just going to
show you my favorite billboard ad of all
time it's cutting edge look at this
that's in piccadilly square
that's height
and it's it's time to every flight every
time a flight takes off you know they'll
be a different kid and they look up at
the sky and they're excited and
it's like a cool it's like uh you know
it's good for their brand
the the magic of flight it's really
creative it's really clever and it's
a really cool way to use billboards that
i hadn't seen before so i liked it a lot
amazon as the number one company
investing in america for the second year
in a row we created 400 000 jobs last
year cnbc reported that amazon paid zero
dollars in federal income taxes
and actually received 129 million tax
rebate from the government
yeah uh well that's smart investing they
put up zero dollars and made 129 million
so actually they invested in america way
better than me i invested in america by
putting in
half my earnings as far as taxes and i
got back nothing so they've out-invested
me by a lot they bought bitcoin america
and i bought dogecoin america
we booked a three-month stay back in
march and put three thousand dollars
down and y'all cancel it on the day
we're supposed to arrive
and then expect to have another 3000 to
dish out right now for a place to stay
on less than six hours notice it's gonna
take 24 hours to issue a refund okay
where am i staying tonight well now they
have no excuse for not responding
[Laughter]
my host just started punching holes in
the drywall won't stop screaming at us i
might be like
they bathed him
they bathed in them and then they hit
him with the real and then they probably
got ghosted to be honest they probably
got ghosted
uber driver said hey sweetie but i heard
hey sawweedy and thought to myself
okay i must look very petite today and
then uber said that's my best friend
which is
which is just weird
i hate
brand personas
i don't want to hear how and i want uber
to send me hearts bro
and then
she said give your driver's health
insurance
which by the way
i'm sorry wait i need to stop for one
second
are you defending this
wait i want everyone who's [ __ ] open
arms about this are you defending this
you think this is good
you think that's a good tweet
then what the [ __ ] is going on
what i'm saying is the easiest way to
get free likes is tweet something that
uber responds to
anything
and then respond by saying pay your
workers
it's a it's golden it's it's guaranteed
likes
just tweet anything that uber and lyft
responds to
and then quote
okay next one okay well i'm just gonna
read it to you before i show you i'm
gonna read it to you okay
bmw
like the bmw brand
with a pride flag as their logo
posted a tweet that asked the following
what do you think is the best way to get
around town and still do our part to
protect the environments hashtag world
environment day and it's a poll
with four options
they gave the people four options the
first option is car sharing the second
option is e-scooters the third option is
public
public transport
and the fourth option is my super
sustainable bmw
that's the fourth option
and i guess they just assumed
that everyone would pick my super
sustainable bmw
[Laughter]
oh no
oh no why would you make it a poll
why would you make it a poll bro
have you met the internet
do you think that everyone's gonna pick
my super sustainable bmw 108 000 votes
that's so funny
that you're just setting yourself to get
dunked
that's like when i ask a rhetorical
question to chat i'm like do you think
i'm really gonna go [ __ ] jump off a
cliff and quit my job and and then they
always go yep they go yep yep yep yep
that's funny yep cause they always they
always answer whatever the obvious
non-answer is that's crazy
to think they were gonna pick this one
that's super funny do you like playing
pokemon
would you like to play pokemon go around
the world the united states navy has the
ability to take you around the world
allow you to play pokemon go
help you achieve the goal of being a
pokemon master
come talk to your local navy recruiter
today and see what the navy can offer
you
this is predatory obviously
but at some point you have to say if you
fall for this
fool me wants shame on you you know what
i'm saying like at this point
if you are like if because they they
can't sign you up for under 18 you have
to be 18. if you are over 18 and you see
this and you're like holy [ __ ] this
sounds great
i do want to be a pokemon master
i don't know what to tell you brother i
can't help you
i can't help you it's that that
i thought it was fake too but it's got
the [ __ ] it just feels like it's
weird to add the
the recruiter cards like this is these
usually are real these i don't think
it's like a full-on the entire navy did
this as a campaign i think two local
recruiters might have tried it

Most Hilarious Ads of All Time | Marketing Monday - YouTube
now we're gonna watch ads uh today's
topic is literally just the funniest ads
of all time part
due let's see what you guys submitted
and i have some funny ones myself
right off the bat sprite sunfiz a 90s
commercial
that's because there's a delicious ray
of sunshine in every drop
come on guys
trust your gut not some cartoon
character
oh it's a sprite commercial that's good
that's good that's clever that one got
me i thought it was just someone making
a parody of real commercials
i would have if they could just include
sprite a little bit more
this is look my only qualm with a lot of
these commercials they get a little bit
too clever
and it's um it's just so easy to forget
what they're for
you you're not you're not gonna even
remember that sprite was associated with
this
because this part's too funny it i don't
know like if they just threw a sprite at
it or something
i would just want to include sprites
somewhere that's my only note but
outside of that hilarious commercial
speaking of marketing let me interrupt
your regularly scheduled programming
here for just a moment
to tell you about an upgrade i'm
planning to make to my life
do you see this disgusting old crummy
splitting broken you can't even call
them headphones whatever i've been
wearing for the last three years
i would like to welcome a new supporter
to marketing monday our friends at
raycon
who provided me with these earbuds that
i've been using for the past
two weeks i wanna talk about the three
things that i actually do love about
these headphones
number one look at this look at this
this is the first earbud i've ever had
that has no danger of falling out it
came with six little size things
when i got it i picked the large one i
put it in it fits
snugly i can use it at the gym i can use
it when taking work calls
and most importantly to me i use it at
night when i'm listening to podcasts
before i go to bed in bed it's a game
changer
okay that combined with reason number
two the long battery life
solves everything i actually use
headphones for for me that's what makes
me happy
in an earbud and so i'm very happy with
these number three it's worth mentioning
i already have them now so it's not
important to me but they're uh
affordable
now from a marketing pov there is a lot
of huge
markups in the branded earbud space
there's some competitors you can
probably think of
that have pretty big markups raycon does
not do that i look at their website it
is literally like
half the cost for same great premium
qualities these are now my number one
uh earbud from what i use on my phone i
use them every night before i go to bed
when i listen to podcasts
the the snug fit the battery life the
audio quality it's all great
um at an affordable price so if you want
to join in if you want to help support
marketing monday and me
and check out a new pair of great ear
buds um go to buy recon dot com slash
hdrock for 50
off your order and uh and thanks again
thanks again breakout for sporting and
thanks again you guys for checking it

is this an actual ad let's find out 15
minutes could save you 15
or more in car insurance oh i know that
well did you know that former pro
football player icky woods will
celebrate almost anything
number 44 whoa 44 that's me
get some cold cuts get some cold cuts
geico 15 minutes could save you 15 or
more on car insurance 44 ladies that's
me
good charisma sold it i also like that
they uh saved a ton of money by getting
a retired football player that probably
would do it for
500 bucks than an actual pro athlete
which would have cost them a ton of more
yeah pretty clever pretty good ad
oh this is a classic hey r.i.p to a
great one
this this commercial is awesome i
remember watching this like this is a
this is a long time ago when i watched
commercial
the kobe system how much more do you
want from me more
how much more successful do you want me
to be more successful
how many records can my records break
more records
but but i'm the best but are you a
different animal
and the same beast
what the [ __ ] does that mean kobe bryant

appropriate
[Laughter]
that's it
[Laughter]
wait there was no point is that just
some dealership owner that wanted to
drive around in a
mercedes shooting people and get filmed
that's one of the worst i've ever seen
and okay if you're going for the kcona
crowd

not even a truck
if it was a truck i guess i could see
the association
oh it's calgary

Who had the better rebrand? - YouTube
all right marketing monday marketing
monday marketing monday marketing monday
now uh how do i put this
uh so here's the truth let me tell you i
have got the wins and fails portion
of marketing monday locked and ready to
go i got some good ones
starting with a massive
win if you guys don't know early on in
marketing monday i found a jingle
for an autozone commercial that somebody
had made it had like 17 views
but we thought it was a banger so we all
commented on it saying how great it was
and then the artist reached out to me he
was an autozone employee
named uh peter scott aka king delroy
he made me a marketing monday intro a
fantastic
one he also made me a song for my
proposal
now king delroy is having uh
a kid he already had a kid but he's
having another kid his wife is pregnant
and i want to give him a huge
congratulations
congrats to king delroy on a new member
of the family i sent him an email
congrats hey peter saw your instagram
post and wanted to say congrats on an
upcoming member of your family
if i had your talent i'd write you a
song about it but i'll save us both the
pain and just say your kid will be super
lucky to have you as a dad
and he said uh that means a lot thank
you so much i appreciate you brandon
and he said i'm releasing my new album
it's called back to the kingdom
you can sample or download it here so
i'm going to give you guys the link in
chat
i just want to shout out my boy king
delroy
and his um his new album back to the
kingdom
my next w is this
i'm talking about the total rebrand of
coke zero sugar
uh entirely new design that i actually
think the design is fine
but where they're getting into trouble
is that they
change the taste and so there's
beginning to be a backlash
from i mean people that like
coke zero sugar apparently and diet coke
and all those
really like it so what i'm hearing
is they might be getting into a new coke
situation
now i think the new design is kind of
slick brash red
yeah it's this height the sticker just
says now more delicious
so but the thing is people are comparing
this new coke now if you don't know what
happened with new coke i don't blame you
was in the 80s but 1995
cocoa again in the middle of the soda
wars feeling pressure from pepsi
released a new coke replacing the
classic coke formula
and the outcry was immense everyone was
angry and terrified and mad
and they said they changed the classic
piece of american tradition
and so uh coke they said okay we back
off and they went back to the original
coke
and everyone thought they won and so
sales of the original coke spiked
so rather than hurting coke it was one
of the biggest boons of all time
but this time around marketers are
smarter and they've learned from that
example
this could theoretically be an exa an
attempt
to get people to talk about coke zero
sugar the truth is
if they hadn't changed the formula and
just rebranded
this wouldn't get as much discussion and
people now want to try the flavors
they want to have a stance they want to
say what's best the whole thing
to me feels a little more calculated
this time around
wait i gotta go i gotta go to lose first
let's go to a lose
uh oh yeah perfect this is not now
this is another win this campaign from
bic lighters featuring martha stewart
and snoop dogg
where it says perfect for candles and
more
which is a dub and i think they actually
made an ad this might be
if i can find the ad hey martha pass me
that big easy reach lighter
in that bowl bowl of strawberries
[Music]
thanks this is perfect for hard to reach
places
perfect for candles grills and so much
more that
the acting is phenomenally bad uh it's
hard to make a lighter ad even remotely
interesting
and this one's funny so uh yeah this is
a dub there's no
dub i this might be mostly dubs i'm
finding a lot of good [ __ ] in the
marketing world
uh all right wait let's go to the next
one uh uh
oh yeah okay so again uh back oh wait
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
here's the l
where i got the l this is the l for
humanity
[Music]
they can dance now
[Applause]
imagine uh an endless
field of human corpses imagine a mass
graveyard
of our best and brightest soldiers
[Music]
this sucks because we were already gonna
lose to the robots
but now that we're gonna be [ __ ]
fortnite dancing on us
not only are we gonna lose to [ __ ] ai
they're gonna make us
feel bad they're also gonna be [ __ ]
toxic about it
uh this is tough for humanity it's bad
for humanity in two ways i mean
listen there's gonna be some positive
externalities from this but in the short
term it's gonna be a
a negative shot i'm not even worried
about them um
rising up and killing us all that's more
of a meme i'm worried about
you know if if they get this complex
once this gets cheaper
this replaces like all physical like
every job a human could do
this is the big l of today's marketing
monday and that's for humanity on these
uh let's see i have oh this is my next w
and that is [ __ ] cloud9
mango we're gonna watch his victory
this is a good market this is why it's
marketing this saved melee
this tournament with the largest prize
pool ever
mango winning crazy storyline tons of
views
this tournament if it had been bad oh
man dude
it's such a branching point if you guys
don't know
zayn came into grand finals zayn on the
right from winners
which means he had to lose the best of
five and putting losers so mango won the
first best of five
then in the second best of five it was
2-2 this is the last game
mango dies here it's last stock they
both have zero percent
that's as even as you can get a game 10
last game last stock even percent
i'm losing my brain crowd going crazy
chad from mango oh the shield dropped
see he's dropping the buttons
his first ever smash summit
you guys don't i don't know if you know
this mango's the youngest person to ever
win a smash major
he did it when he was like 13 years old
or something pound way back in the day
and he's now the oldest person to have
won a smash major with this event
yesterday
i think it i think this tournament
cemented him as the goat
i don't think anything else could i
think the fact that he came back
from so many slumps to win against
the best to do it right now zayn
so many years after he's been i mean
this is just crazy that's
that's the comeback story of like any
sport that's and uh
and and the best marketing melee could
ask for is this
there's no ad you could do that's better
than this storyline
this moment uh it's got people
interested in melee i could already see
people checking it out wanting to watch
more
the next tournament's gonna have more
views because of this you know i i never
um i said this to my dad when i was
growing up i like sports more now than i
did when i was a kid
when i was a kid i was always like i
like games all right [ __ ] sports
which is a cringe thing to say because
you can like whatever but at the time i
didn't like him
and i never understood when my dad would
get so hyped watching like
football right and i i first felt it
when i watched mango
in tournament when i was in person in
the [ __ ] front row cheering for mango
i understood what it was like to be a
sports fan
and it made me go like actual sports um
all right so that was that that was uh
that was a dub
and i think i have let's see i'm going
through wins and fails here
i have an l my l is for
everyone else trying to make it as a
content creator
that's not quackity cause quackity
figured out
some [ __ ] real [ __ ] can we please
talk about the way quackity shows his
reactions
through expressions when he's impressed
or happy you can see it in his face
oh [ __ ]
he could he's using his face he doesn't
have to just say i'm happy
he's showing it do you guys understand
me like whenever i watch and react to
content i just say
this is funny but what he can do is
literally like make his
like move his lips or something to make
it look like he's happy or he thinks
it's funny like he's smiling
this is a huge huge l for other creators
and then my final dub and this is a
marketing monday after all
goes to a man who has
mastered modern uh social media
marketing
is little nas x with his new free
little nasdaq campaign uh with this
video we're just gonna watch it
give him the dad are you okay
yeah i'm bored i'm gonna call you back
though i'm doing this little court case
for nike
ladies and gentlemen of the jury
this is about much more than shoes mr
are you gay what does this have to do
with the shoes
answer the question let me rephrase the
question
do your mama know you gay
yes lock them up throw away the key
order order i sentence you to five years
in montero state prison
anyway it's great it's amazing marketing
through and through but what's clever
about it is that
you know he built this whole campaign
about you know he might go to jail
look he's even saying like uh montero
state prison
so the whole thing is just like a
[ __ ] clever way to respond
to the controversy from the last thing
he did so he just keeps doing things
that are controversial getting
attention and then feeding off in a more
creative way
it's just uh it's just smart it's just
really smart and that's my final dub
for my wins and fails congrats a little
nazi actually win the marketing monday
award of the week
oh i have one more wait i have one more
i have one more l
you know how uh we talked about reality
shifting earlier and it's basically how
some zoomers are so sad about our
current reality they're just like opting
out
[ __ ] current reality i'm gonna go
anywhere else canada
has realized they're so bad at marketing
that they're opting out
with canada's new no name brand
first of all this existed for a while in
canada but it actually already existed
in america it was called brandless
and so they're copying things from
america again and also
brandless failed dramatically
i don't want to buy [ __ ] yellow cola
though i'm pretty sure i mean i would
assume the cola sells worse
but maybe the baking soda like things
that are more generic equivalents
well the idea behind brands is that by
not branding they can save costs
because marketing is expensive costs for
goods like these so they can sell it
cheaper
but the problem is that selling it
cheaper with no brand just makes people
think it's bad
so it doesn't work maybe canada has
found a way to turn brainless into a
successful business
we'll see all right so that's those are
my wins and fails and i think those were
pretty uh
[ __ ] fun
you
The Truth about The OnlyFans Ban - YouTube
this is like a mini marketing monday
it's going to be a marketing monday on a
wednesday and i'm just going to talk a
little bit about what's going on with
only fans and what my thoughts are i'm
going to talk about only fans here for a
second and i think it's been the big
story of the past week and a lot of
people tag me a lot of people dm me and
said yo can you talk about how this
stupid only decisions only fan
decision is like talk about how stupid
it is talk about
how dumb they are like why would they do
this
what's going on i think a lot of the
takes i've seen on the only fen
situation have been very uh surface
level so i'm gonna try and give you one
layer deeper
tuesday august 17th
uh only fans which is based in the uk
announced a new app called only fans tv
a new free app separate from only fans
that is completely free of adult content
okay a separate only fans tv app it's
got fitness stuff it's got cooking stuff
it's got comedy stuff and most
importantly it's got no users
nobody used it
okay
an average to of 200 downloads a day
during the peak of only fans hysteria in
the past five days it averaged a max of
seven thousand downloads so it's global
total downloads that means global across
the entire world for being out for
months of only fans tv are 72 000 which
is terrible that's not a business
that's like a
 that's like a bad youtube video
on my channel
they launched only fans tv and they were
well aware there was no audience
for a cooking and fitness based
only fans
okay they're not stupid they are fully
aware that the money their cash cow is
sex workers titties being out makes them
money they are not stupid okay i want
you guys to just get that part in they
are stupid for other reasons that we're
gonna get to that but on a deep
fundamental level they did understand
that they need titties to make profit
titties equals dollars also one of their
lead investors
leonid radvinsky he is um the majority
owner of only fans and he has 20 years
in the porn industry investing in a
million different porn sites okay
he's not like a prude this guy's not
like oh we have to get the adult content
off of only fans and i don't care what
it costs us okay i think a lot of the
takes i saw and only fans were like oh
these guys are stupid they don't know
that only that titty is what makes them
money they are not
you have to be so stupid so okay on
tuesday they launched that up um
on
thursday
there's been some outside investors get
reported so investors are people that
are like let's say your business needs
money to grow you go to these big
outside investors hedge funds rich
people and you get millions of dollars
and they get a cut of your company
outside investors in general some of
them were scared off by only fans being
adult content focused later that day
after that report comes out
the company out of the blue sort of
abruptly announces
that it's going to prohibit users from
posting any sexually explicit content
starting october 1st okay and that's
like almost no time so they said
basically like you know two weeks all
the adult content is gonna be off the
site out of the blue really weird same
day that report comes out and of course
this is where they were stupid
the backlash is immediate and immense
okay huge backlash everyone's
on them all their creator on
them all of like fans lee and fan house
and all their competitors are like
seeing stars this is their chance to
break the monopoly the other cold take
is that
this was all a five-head genius strategy
to get people to talk about only fans
no that's not they're also not that
smart they're not that dumb as to all as
to think they don't need titties and
they're not that smart to be
nine head planning this okay the truth
of the matter is
all of the money and only fans which has
to pay out hundreds of millions of
dollars to craters every month goes
through a few big banks and the big
banks
are scared
of being associated with any illegal
activity and the big banks are also run
by in general proofs
there's like
a law where if a bank is found to have
harbored money
that is funneled through any illegal
activity they can receive massive
massive fines and penalties okay so to
play it overly safe most of these big
banks avoid being associated with the
adult industry altogether for example
you can't buy a subscription to pornhub
with a visa or mastercard that's why i
use for my pornhub diamond tier
membership quack salary i take it out of
the paypal and i just i buy it right up
so that's
anyway so the banks basically were
freezing only fans money they were
stopping them from getting the lines of
credit and the size of accounts they
would need to pay out all their creators
and only fans was very worried because
if they ever did get frozen they would
not be able to pay out their top
creators and that let me tell you
something bad press can cost you some of
your creators but at the end of the day
no one was leaving until they're
actually booted off
but if they don't pay out if you miss a
payout that's when you lose everybody if
twitch stopped paying out top creators
for even a month youtube would get a
million new streamers okay if you ever
don't pay out that's when things go
crazy and so only fans is worried about
that so this is what their plan was and
this is again my theory but um i think
it's pretty well backed up but what i've
been able to find out they weren't even
really trying to ban
99 of what's on on uh
on their platform they understand that
titties makes them money
what they were trying to do
was publicly announce that you know the
extreme end of the pornography will not
be tolerated so they could have swaged
the banks
and make the banks okay with giving them
the clearance to get the money they need
okay they were trying to make it seem
like there's going to be nothing over
the line here just pure old-fashioned
plain jane titties
so that they and then only show the
fitness stuff and the cooking stuff so
that they can get all the money they
need to keep paying out the 90 adult
creators okay they're well aware that
was their plan the problem is that the
banks aren't the only ones that saw this
message okay they thought that maybe
creators wouldn't care or they wouldn't
get the backlash they got but the
backlash they got was insane
the backlash they got was immense and
extreme and it was a huge bonus
for their competitors and so they
realized holy
you know hurting our business this way
is going to be worse than just figuring
out some kind of deal with the banks
later on it was worded towards softcore
but my honest opinion is that their goal
was just to say something so they could
get the deals and then kind of look the
other way and not really enforce
basically any of the changes again their
goal is to make money and everyone from
a branding pov knows that only fans will
never become the place for fitness and
cooking
now that being said
in the 80s there was a
a big release of a soda drink soda drink
a new coke okay and it was an entirely
new formula that was essentially ripped
off of pepsi's and it was sweeter coke
sales were going down pepsi was going up
and then they came out with new coke and
then coke sales went down even more and
everyone hated new coke
and they demanded to bring back the old
coke and they got all rallied up about
it and then so coke did
and because of that everyone realized
how much they loved coke
and they were like rejuvenating their
love for the brand they felt like they
won and then coke sales spiked to the
roof and everyone was like was that
genius was that a genius nine head
marketing play to release a bad second
product so everyone could feel like they
won no they were just stupid and lucky
well guess who's also stupid and lucky
only fans
okay only fans is stupid and lucky that
this stupid up of theirs caused
search interest for only fans to reach
an all-time high with the biggest
question being what is only fans
and in fact their site traffic their
site traffic is now at all time highs
during a time when overall internet
traffic is down like point five percent
their site driving was up 20
uh luckily they were also fast enough to
act to reverse their uh
the bad pr they were getting end of the
day though they haven't solved the core
problem
it's not like it's over for them
being closely associated with adult
content and sex work makes the banks
nervous and they need hundreds of
millions of dollars every month to pay
out creators
so they've kind of just
kicked the can down the road and we'll
see if they can solve that
what's the solution i mean listen
they're printing money hand over fist
they are making an absolutely insane
amount of money
i'm sure like most businesses that are
making an insane amount of money they'll
find a way at the end of the day banks
like money
okay
they may have to make a few um edge case
rules they have to make some
uh
big showy moderation team
and again i'm not saying none of them
were stupid enough to think that they
could go legit
but the ones that were launched only
fans tv and saw it flop
months and months of no downloads total
flop all right so the
the the leadership of the company is
well aware that like if they don't go
adult they don't make any money
anyway i hope that i hope that helped
clear up some of what's going on because
i think uh
i think the two takes i saw were like
this is nine head by only fans and then
like oh my god they completely don't get
it porn is like so important to only
fans how could they be so stupid oh one
more thing my only fans launches next
week
and let me tell you it is gonna be
hot i'm talking about steamy marketing
advice
okay
hitman clicks like you've never seen
i'm talking about killing one two three
people at the same time
i'm talking about
hollow knight
i'm gonna go around reddit comments and
anyone that calls anyone a cheater in
holland i'm gonna do what they say can't
be done
okay that's the kind of fire only fans
content you're gonna see
The Taco Bell of the Future - YouTube
we've got a lot of things to talk about
we're going to do wins and fails
starting with uh the first win of the
week
is taco bell actually you can call it a
win or a fail i just kind of like you
guys thoughts on this i called it a win
because i think they're trying new stuff
it's the release of their new uh
restaurant design basically the taco
bank with like
vastly vastly expanded uh drive-through
design because people aren't eating in
the restaurant as much it's basically
designed for a future where there's a
lot more door dash uber eats drive
through that it does look kind of
sinister i got a video here of let's see
more it looks less like less sinister
right in a daylight like this this taco
bell actually the kitchen sits up on a
second level and then it has essentially
four kitchens in that large kitchen and
each one of those kitchens delivers food
to a different lane beneath there's
actually no inside dining there is a
pedestrian or customer entrance and
small vestibule lobby where you can walk
in
place an order wait for it and and leave
but there's no dining inside or he's so
serious about it this guy's life's work
is architecting the new taco bell and he
is very serious about it and i respect
that one word of advice from the
planners when this project wraps up next
summer there could be a slight learning
curve i hope there's not too much of a
learning curve it's it's not that crazy
america
what the [ __ ] is going on what do i even
do
there's four lanes i'm hoping we don't
have a [ __ ] societal collapse over
trying to navigate the new taco bell it
looks pretty self-explanatory i don't
know my personal opinion is a win i
think taco bell has been sort of on the
innovative side of fast food they're
trying a lot of new things um they were
one of the quickest adopters of uh food
delivery and uh outside of dominoes was
actually the goat of pioneering apps and
food delivery they did the anime fries
commercial yeah i don't know i think
this is pretty sick i think i think it's
this could work pretty well and again if
it actually cuts times in half for the
same quality of food pretty pog which
lane gives me extra beans
what if you cannot afford a car they
literally just said they had a bike lane
two seconds ago and a pedestrian lane
two seconds ago they said that they're
so right you're not gonna get it
america's not gonna get it oh my god he
had like four pieces of information and
one of them was that there's gonna be a
bike lane and you're like what if i
don't have a car though what am i gonna
do then taco bell checkmate uh that's my
win i'm gonna give it a win all right
but we gotta balance that out with a
fail let me give a fail to every other
youtube commenter on my channel because
i now have a new goat that's right
bad boy halo watched my hitman vid
that's right i'm in the dream smp now
i'm in the group this is the beginning
of my future friendship with dream i
might be on manhunts next who knows okay
he both watched and commented he is a
fan okay he loves the content i am now
turning my entire channel into
muffin-based content to hopefully
attract another bad boy halo viewing
finally you can quit that side thing
with nvidia
if i get invited to the dream smp we'll
consider it so um this past week the cmo
chief marketing officer of hyundai said
that all auto brands are spending way
too much on tv ads and google search
that's what he said and so
in response his team uh in response his
team created this
the hyundai mobility adventure in roblox
uh and i think we have a video for you
this is the future of marketing
[Music]
[Music]
are you ready
are you ready
[Music]
wow
there's nothing cooler than calling your
game the hyundai mobility adventure
and let me tell you for all the seven
and eight-year-olds out there who are
currently in the market for a mid-sized
sedan you have been seen hyundai sees
you
they see you and they're building an
experience for you
yeah so this is a major win what a
genius marketing concept the reason
there's so many car ads on tv is because
the primary demographic of tv watchers
is like 45 plus with disposable income
who are in the market for a car but
hyundai said that let's get the youth of
america hooked on the mobility adventure
of hyundai the unfortunate part is it
hasn't really taken off to a great start
it has currently 6 000 views but we can
pump those numbers up the comments are
that came out of nowhere really random
to have happened but okay and that's it
and then one person
kevin t
who was probably the [ __ ] executive
that worked in this project
said hyundai represents the future of
mobility
it's just trying to drum up some
comments
because he's got to go back to his boss
and show him these [ __ ] numbers
uh so that's the win did i have another
fail what was my fail oh yeah oh yeah
yeah yeah uh my fail was uh what was
about this i needed to bring this up
where is it every other twitch streamer
who didn't get the [ __ ] bag that tim
and lupo got let's watch [ __ ] tim's
video on his leave to youtube hello
anybody here
hey i didn't see you there i'm tim the
tapman and i have a huge announcement
now before we go to the future i want to
take you on a journey through my past
let's take a look at some of the odd
jobs i've done over the years shall we
good morning mr jackson
the best paper boy in upstate new york
and i won't be told otherwise
see what we got behind door number two
thank you so much for dining with us
today ma'am would you like any hot sauce
on your tacos you would
here you go
well that would have been my job i i
listen i love tim i uh
why does every like did ninja just start
this trend that everyone thinks they
have to do like a video
like they have to do like a sketch
comedy thing for when they announce a
platform move
it's not required it's not legally you
don't have to do this you know you can
just say i just wanted to know i mean
this is fine i think tim's gonna hype it
i'm glad he got the bag let's see what
we got behind this door
what is up guys tim the time in here
bringing you a vlog from my phone up
here we have the [ __ ] duct tape
specialty once again my name is tim the
tatman uh tatman army represent love you
guys
tad man army thank you so much for all
the support and love over all these
years it's time for the next big thing
of my career the future
team
join me on youtube gaming it's time
the future is now
well that was the peak of comedy comedy
has now peaked no one else should even
try um but i do want to say uh you know
it's it's pretty big
that the spending on twitch streamers
has started or on streamers in general
has started to pick up again there was
the first wave with mixer mixer was
throwing money around again microsoft
the most viable company on planet earth
they had a lot of money to throw around
they did and it was leading to big
contracts pokemon tim
lupo lyric doc they all got big twitch
contracts because twitch was threatened
by the rise of mixer and youtube youtube
was doing big contracts for valkyrie
courage back then as well and then there
was a lull for the past like year and a
half there's been a bit of a lull where
the cold war kind of started up and they
stopped spending so much and right in
that time was kind of the worst time to
blow up if you wanted to get a big deal
so it kind of felt bad for someone like
i don't know ms kiff ludwig uh cause
they
they're both gigantic and did not get a
good renegotiation you know what i'm
saying they're not getting a fat
contract from twitch now eventually
someone's gonna give i i don't wanna
leak or say anything but something's
gonna give because they're too big to
like could not get paid but you know if
it happened to them a year earlier they
would have made a lot more money it's
it's funny that like ninja hit the 200
000 subs and got 40 million dollars
and ludwig get the 200 000 subs
and claims to have made three thousand
dollars
it's just it's a it's a difference it's
a difference in uh timing he obviously
made a lot more than that but he still
didn't make a giant contract from mixer
that only had to do half a year for
ninja still remains undefeated as the
ultimate bag in all of esports in all of
esports all of gaming no one has made a
bag like ninja as a content creator ever
40 million dollars to only have to
stream for half a year and then come
back and then and then even though he
didn't tell them he's gonna stream
league of legends only and not give a
[ __ ]
twitch paid him a huge bag to come back
because when ninja came back from mixer
he did that if you guys remember this
ninja very smartly did exactly two
streams in the off season after mixer
died he did one stream on youtube and
one stream on twitch and for both those
streams he got every single famous
friend he knew to join him to help pump
the numbers up and so his two streams
back were 100k plus viewers each it was
like him lupo
tim courage and so youtube and twitch
execs were like holy [ __ ] he still draws
100k when he gets back
even after a mixer he gets 100k and
twitch paid him fat stacks and then
after all that he comes back to tuition
just plays the league
bro he got the same amount of subs as me
with a better split twitch is making
nothing off of him i mean he outplayed
him he outplayed him like crazy he
outplayed them like crazy these big
platform deals are hard to say no to
because especially if you're not like
incredibly still hungry to grow they
provide you like the stability of being
like i'm good with twitch you could you
could be hot one day and and gone the
next like you don't know to not have to
rely on that and just have guaranteed
income is pretty sick and that's why
lupo and tim both cashed out it was
funny that you know there was that whole
day off of twitch movement it was kind
of funny and a little weird
that tim announced his
departure on that day
everyone was saying day off of twitch
and he said i'm just off i'm [ __ ]
life off of twitch and look if they get
enough people i i've heard the same
thing uh but let's also do something in
the yard there's definitely more coming
youtube is is playing a game here where
they want to get a lot of people they're
not pulling the mixer where they get one
or two and then quit they're they're
coming for a lot more and not for not
for just the biggest sizes the only
thing i think twitch really has that's
unbeatable right now is prime if prime
goes away or if youtube finds a counter
to prime then they'll [ __ ] all bets
are off the war is open would you make
the jump i mean if they threw a [ __ ]
million plus at me
then i would never do that okay because
i can ride or die
i do want
i'm saying this right now
i want twitch to negotiate with me on my
sub split and if they don't do it i'm
gonna be [ __ ] pissed someone at
twitch i worked there for four years i
know your names someone better talk to
me i know the normal sizes you get to
start negotiating a better split and i
passed that and you're still not talking
to me someone better [ __ ] talk to me
i think that might be it for wins and
fails i think that was the main ones i'm
sort of interested i'm gonna keep up on
where this uh stream wars goes because i
think it's heating up again i think
we're in like phase two of the war the
real showdown between youtube gaming and
twitch a lot more streamers are gonna
get deals i think twitch is gonna have
to respond by signing some deals of
their own and uh right now twitch is
playing the wait and see because twitch
at the end of the day already loses
money okay twitch loses more money than
it makes and so they're always like do
we really need to outbid on tim the
tatman like if he leaves does it really
hurt us or do we just lose a couple of
his die-hard fans and then people watch
someone else they need to know that and
they are watching very closely right now
to see like what does it actually mean
to let somebody big go they did it with
ninja they let ninja go it didn't hurt
twitch at all not one bit only person
that was hurt was like i guess ninja's
viewer base they have to find out how
much it actually hurts to let it happen
and if it does hurt then they'll spend
they'll spend big bucks if conor leaves
it's over for twitch if conor leaves
twit twitch don't even call it twitch
if conor the ninja of twitch leaves
there's nothing left the culture is gone
the soul is gone if i worked at youtube
i would have i would have just gotten
all of the dream sp guys at once because
that's a [ __ ] huge cohort of young
people that only watch minecraft
creators and other minecraft creators
like your snp and other creators and
they're gonna grow up with new habits so
if you get them all while they're young
to watch [ __ ] wilbur soot and dream
and tommy in it and everyone on youtube
then they'll just watch youtube live
forever they don't even use emotes yet
yeah exactly tommy and it streams for
[ __ ] three hours and it's equals xqc
for 14. them and otv yeah i think
getting those groups are pretty
interesting because those groups are
pretty die hard can kids even do
contracts you can do with their parents
well you think child actors don't get
paid
you think uh [ __ ] daniel radcliffe
just did harry potter for the love of
the [ __ ] witchcraft
he just like [ __ ] i just love doing
movies did it for his resume
he did get some exposure i will say that

bye
The Most Expensive Ads of All Time - YouTube
now we're gonna get into the actual
marketing monday and the marketing
monday today is a good one the most
expensive ads of all time these are the
10 most expensive ads ever created they
all are above 5 million
just to make not even to place on tv or
on billboards or or wherever it's just
to make most of them were made for the
super bowl and some of them we've
already watched if you're a die-hard
marketing monday fan you've seen some of
these ads but we're going to watch them
again with a new lens because we didn't
know how much they cost now we know how
much they cost and we're gonna see if
are they worth it was it worth this
extra money because you could shoot a
very cheap ad that has amazing viral
potential some ads were shot for 20
grand 15 20 grand or less and they they
went absolutely viral did huge numbers
were incredible and some ads are
incredibly expensive and worthless
so we want to see if these 10 ads lived
up to the hype of their expensive uh
pedigree so
let's start with
this 2014 ad
by microsoft the most valuable company
in the world called empowering
what is technology
what can it do
when i lost my eyesight i thought that
my painting days were over
how far can we go technology has the
power to unite us hang on honey hang
it gives hope to the hopeless and it has
given voice to the voiceless
[Music]
okay
my first thought is how the did that
cost five million dollars where did the
money go i guess they must have an
expensive director let me check my notes
here oh well okay the ad starts former
nfl players steve gleason of the new
orleans saints
and that cost money
maybe the stephen hawking voice was he
alive in 2014 was that he was okay um
then yes that was probably actually
that's probably it well listen i don't
know what do you guys think on this ad
my my listen it's a i think it's bad i'm
gonna say it i'm gonna say i think it's
a bad ad because it literally is one of
those um ads you completely do not
associate with microsoft at all it's not
a product based ad now not every ad has
to be for a specific product that's
supposed to be like a branding ad where
it's like
they want to associate microsoft with
technology for the betterment of
humanity i thought it was a google ad
yeah i just i that's the problem is i
don't think i don't think you walk away
with the with the intended effect was it
uh was it moving on its own like if it
was part of like a documentary and
technology i would be moved i like
seeing some of the footage they had in
there but i think as an ad
i don't think you watch that and walk
away thinking yeah microsoft's really
making a difference their company or
brand or products or anything with it at
all and that that's a lot of money to
spend to not get really any brand take
away i think most people that watched it
would not walk away even knowing what
brand it was for microsoft missed the
mark on this one so i'm gonna give it
i'm gonna give it a thumbs down for for
the price tag of 5 million plus
microsoft empowering but let's go to the
next one kia's the truth ad also from
2014 8 million dollars by kia
let me tell you why you're here it is
the world of luxury that has been pulled
over your eyes to blind you from the
truth we just want to get our car take
the blue key you go back to the luxury
you know you take the red key yeah can i
already tell where the money came from
they literally got lawrence fishburne to
play his character from the matrix by
the way the matrix came out in 1999
this commercial from 2014. this is such
a dated reference by the time they
that
and you'll never look at luxury the same
again
this is unreal no
it's very real this is what luxury looks
like this
is what it feels like
and this
is what it sounds like
[Applause]
[Music]
me
[Music]
chance
[Music]
what the
why did they go through all the effort
of like having him be exactly like the
matrix and have all these made
i feel like they can abandon ship i feel
like they had this whole set set up to
do a matrix parody the red spoon red
dress the agents and the thing and they
were like wait a minute this is kind of
boring what if we just have him sing
it makes no sense
morpheus never sang it wasn't like a
character trait i don't know why they
thought it's so lay random i don't blame
them for taking the bag but it's like
this is an iconic role and now you're
just like doing do you take the red key
or the blue key for great luxury in a
kia you know what i'm saying it's like
bass that red keyed
uh i gotta say this ad is bad i hate to
be um overly critical here but how is
this ad it's so
the whole whole concept is tone deaf
because it's so delayed and then there's
nothing clever about it really and then
they just throw in this random singing
scene that's ad number two and i'm gonna
give that i mean i think it's it's got
kia in it so i think it's better than
the last one but it was odd the reason
it was so expensive is clear they had to
get laurence fishburne and the rights to
his matrix character but let's go to
number eight and see if it's any better
this one is by jaguar we've actually
watched this one if you're a die-hard
marketing monday head it's called
british villains and this one also cost
eight million dollars
have you ever noticed how in hollywood
movies all the villains are played by
prince
maybe we just sound right good evening
sir thank you mary
we're more focused
more precise
with a certain style
an eye for detail
[Music]
i can tell it's expensive
[Music]
and we all drive jaguars
[Music]
oh yes
it's good to be bad
listen opinions are different i like it
i think that's a good ad uh let me tell
you a couple reasons why number one they
at least you can see where the money
went that is not an ad you watch and go
how do they spend eight million dollars
in that it's very obvious and the second
reason i like it is because they very
very tied it back to the product
especially at the end
it seems a little on the nose or not
subtle enough to have them say and they
all drive jaguars at the end i think
it's necessary i think the goal of a
high-end luxury car like a jag
is to associate itself
with that element of sophistication of
class of worldliness i think they picked
the right actors for it i think they did
a good job i listen i'm not really in
the market for a jag but if you're the
type of person who might have that
income and might be attracted that type
of lifestyle i think that ad is up your
alley did it need to be that expensive i
don't know but i think if it looked any
cheaper it would really undercut what
they were going for that one i give my
tentative first thumbs up let's go to
the next one this one's for carlton
drought which is a beer brand that i
haven't really heard of as an aussie
brand okay from 2008 they spent nine
million dollars on this ad let's see
what they got for it right off the bat
it says you must be over 18 to views
advertisement so chat we had a good run
i had a lot of viewers today um i'm
happy about it but
you guys got to get out [ __ ] eight of
you that can watch this still stick
around
and now ladies and gentlemen
the carlton draft halftime spectacular
oh
[Music]
[Applause]
oh my god
[Applause]
[Music]
congratulations
[Music]
wouldn't make me buy it
[Music]
sorry
[Applause]
damn
that was a great ad
hey australia represent that was a that
was a great ad i was genuinely funny
yeah i mean it turned out great i don't
know i think it has genuine shock value
it's memorable the product is featured
massively but in a way that feels
authentic yeah i thought it was great i
thought it i thought it was really good
it's a well made out you should be proud
of this whoever made this whatever
agency made this should feel like they
[ __ ] crushed it this is a great ad
for it didn't have morpheus singing
which was a bit of a knock i'd dock a
couple points because morpheus never
sang at what point but outside of that
king [ __ ] people that were australian in
my chat were already saying it was
iconic they've heard of this ad so
speaking of 12 million ads it's a 12.1
million ad slightly more expensive from
chrysler and this is an ad we've
actually seen before
and it features one marshall mathers
i got a question for you what does this
city know about luxury what is a town
that's been to hell and back know about
the finer things in life it's the
hottest fires that make the heart of
steel
bad hard work and conviction
and the know-how that runs generations
deep in every last one of us that's who
we are
that's our story
now it's probably not the one you've
been reading in papers
the one being written by folks who've
never even been here now we're from
america
but this isn't new york city
or the windy city
or sin city
and we're certainly no one's emerald
city
this is the motor city
this is what we do
[Music]
uh so last time i talked about this i
had a lot of problems with this line i
wanted to know what he was what is that
it that we're doing you know it's just
so weird for him to stroll up to an
empty theater with a choir that's going
that bows their heads to him and then he
turns the camera and says this is what
we do like
is this what what is this what are you
doing that is what i said before and i'm
gonna stick to my guns here uh listen
what i've heard from further research is
that this ad obviously is very popular
in michigan and i think that makes sense
i think the problem here is that this ad
is very um isolating to the rest of the
country and it's a super bowl ad you're
selling these cars across the country if
not globally and you spend half the ad
like kind of insulting other cities and
then eminem comes out of nowhere and
says a weird line it doesn't make a lot
of sense so
i'm gonna have to call this ad mid to
bad but if you are if you're in detroit
if you're in michigan my understanding
is that eminem does like anything that
requires eminem to leave his house is
incredibly hard to do we're now down to
the top three the top three most
expensive ads of all time get ready
let's get to the big ones this is where
the money starts to get really intense
number three aviva british insurance
company changed their name to aviva in
2008 and they wanted to announce it with
a bang
by the way before i get into it i'm
already a little
they describe this ad this let me say
the tagline the tagline for this or the
description for this ad is when british
insurance company norwich union changed
its name to aviva in 2008 they wanted
people to notice why you're an insurance
company bro and we didn't they spent
over 13.4 million dollars it's
undoubtedly parklane's week of the year
would any of this have happened to me if
it has still been richard starkey
he's a new yorker
would walter willis have got to play the
leading man
sometimes a change of name is more than
a change of name sometimes it's a chance
to show the world who you've always
wanted to be
[Music]
what a [ __ ]
terrible oh what a terrible [ __ ] ad
what a waste of money
no one cares most importantly
nobody in your [ __ ] ad bruce willis
looks like he could not give two shits
he can't wait to get off set tell people
why they should care about your company
dude this is so up your own ass at the
end of the day no one gives a [ __ ] what
your insurance company is called tell us
what you do tell us how you're gonna
save me money and by the way norwich
union yeah it probably is a better name
because you kind of want to like for an
insurance company you're not looking for
a viva sounds like a [ __ ] drug aviva
sounds like a [ __ ] erectile
dysfunction pill geico would never do
this geico always reinforces that you
can save money by turning to geico i
can't walk away with this ad it's a it's
a big thumbs down and it's so expensive
what what an obscenely expensive ad that
you could have got across by the way an
insurance company like in the height of
the [ __ ] recession doing an
over-the-top expensive ad
promoting their name change is that
[ __ ]
massively tone deaf oh they're bankrupt
now wait are they aviva
[Laughter]
they bankrupt
they're in a bankruptcy suit
[Laughter]
what a terrible [ __ ] company
now our last beer ad by carlton drought
was pretty good let's see if this one
matches up this is a guinness ad called
tipping point from 07 that cost 16
million dollars in 07.
[Music]
what
[Music]
this was actually done like not cgi
my understanding was practical
[Applause]
[Music]
oh my god
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
um
okay the the stunt is cool and i assume
when you see it in higher quality it's
even more
um intriguing it doesn't really have
anything to do with beer and the ending
reveal is you know it's okay why does
why does good things come to those who
wait and have anything to do with
guinness beer do you have to wait to get
guinness beer i don't know i feel like
the core concept was interesting
visually interesting you know i'm not
bored halfway through i kind of want to
see what happens they kind of put beer
in there somewhere there's not even a
celebrity in this cost 13 plus million
dollars probably for a million reshoots
and a lot of setup and i think that
guinness ad i'm gonna say bad didn't
really make a lot of sense didn't make
sense on branding but now that leaves us
with one more ad the number one ad by a
long shot the next ad is by far the most
expensive ad ever made and it's not
close the next ad is more than the
previous two the aviva names ad and the
guinness tipping point ad combined it
cost a whopping 33 plus million dollars
that is the budget of many small movies
33 million dollars just to film the
commercial and then later they had to
actually um spend more money to put it
on tv and place it i'm talking of course
about the film by chanel let's watch
the film and again all of us in chat are
the prime target audience for chanel 33
million 2004 so this is closer to 50
million dollars spent on a [ __ ]
commercial chanel number five
the film
[Music]
when did i wake
[Music]
into this dream
i must have been the only person in the
world
who didn't know
who she was
[Music]
[Music]
i love to dance
[Music]
[Music]
forgotten
i know
i will not
or kiss
or smile
[Music]
or perfume
that was
50 million dollars uh i
am a little confused as to where the f
that money went the main things i can
find is that it starred nicole kidman
obviously very expensive and they got
director boz lehrman who directed romeo
and juliet and a couple other things
he's a famous director and clearly he
went all out
on this ad uh they were also apparently
both at the height of their fame in 2004
so they cost they cost a lot of money
and uh it was a three minute ad that was
the two minute cut down so we actually
missed a minute that was probably what
we didn't like it they actually built
new york city for that ad
they didn't want to film in new york
because that would be too dirty so they
built a gigantic duplicate
on a set
it includes costume costumes designed by
carl lagerfield apparently a famous
costume production
person this did not premiere to the
super bowl instead it debuted in movie
theaters with the movie bridget jones
the edge of reason like a pixar intro
they put this three-minute short film uh
and apparently this short
cost almost as much as the full-length
two-hour film it preceded
listen i'm not a great judge of women's
perfume ads right maybe maybe the
in 2004 that is an effective ad for
getting you interested but i think we
can all agree that seems like it cost
too much they could have gotten a
similar effect for cheaper in fact i
don't even think it needed to be nicole
kidman my call is a thumbs down a bit of
a waste of money and i think we had one
takeaway today it's that most of these
ads are
pretty big waste of money i think if you
feel like you have to spend 10 20 30
million dollars on your ad you could
probably find a different concept if the
concept for your ad requires you to
spend dozens of millions of dollars
maybe just rethink the concept and find
a different a different concept that
saves you money there's got to be a more
creative way than trying to bash money
down on people's throats but you decide
let me know in the comments that's the
end of today's marketing monday tune in
next week for a new marketing monday
this one on video games i have it
planned already
[Music]
WHO WON? - YouTube
first we're gonna get into wins and
fails starting with my first fail and
this fail is on every other
gaming developer because the gauntlet
has been thrown i'm sick of games that
don't have good
compelling deep characters i'm sick of
games they don't have storylines that
grab you and hook you that have dialogue
that makes you think wow i'm in a real
living breathing world and that's why
when i saw this footage from the latest
nba 2k game i said
gaming has forever changed
hey neighbor are you
jake from state farm oh you hang out
here bro yeah hey right next to the
course in your neighborhood hey that's
so fam hey speaking of being a good
neighbor i like to welcome you to the
city very excited to have the great mp
as my newest neighbor it's good to know
hey as i show my support i'd like to
offer you my official look
can't join team staphon without the
drift
right awesome i'll be seeing you around
and pete let me know if you need
anything and remember like a good
neighbor stay farm is bad
i appreciate this they can stay fun yeah
hey listen pleasure's all mine keep
doing your thing
unskippable cut scene that is the future
of gaming that is powerful i am so
excited for a world where i can walk
around getting accosted by unskippable
dialogue cutscenes where my character
expresses enthusiasm for the products of
a big multinational corporation i love
this i love paying 50 60 maybe in the
future 70
for a game that's filled to the brim
with ads
for other goods and services on top of
paid dlc and pack openings
yes
yes and i feel like this is like a
[ __ ] challenge it's like every other
developer is on notice dude they look at
this and they're like you're behind
maybe some of you have pay to win maybe
some of you have pack openings maybe
some of you have ads but are you doing
all three
are you putting them all together that's
what i want to see so that's my first
fail is on everyone else for not keeping
up but let's get a win going here i saw
what is one of the coolest ads i've ever
seen one of the coolest outdoor ads you
know uh billboards have been pretty
plain and standard and unchanged for
decades now billboards are pretty much
like a really basic marketing medium
there's not not been a lot of innovation
and i saw this
ad from korea
from a mall that i've been to in korea
and was kind of blown away at uh what's
been done so i want to show you this
jeep billboard from i believe the coax
mall in korea
that's badass dude i thought that was
super there's a bunch of these i mean i
actually think maybe it's in the it
might be in the replies yeah there's
this lion one
[Music]
this water one where it looks like it's
full of water
i mean i don't know if you've seen the
back to the future movies but this is
literally better than what it looked
like in those movies where the jaws
thing came out of the this is like the
future is here does it only work from
that angle yeah i believe the angle
matters a lot but it's also like it's
set up to where the main walkway angle
is where you see it most beautifully so
there was a good one the pepsi one last
one some k-pop star first commercial i
don't even know i mean it's still the
worst one of the 3d ones but
this one's like the most basic one right
they just made the pepsi float around
him so i wasn't that impressed but it
was still cool i mean it's still a cool
use of a billboard it definitely draws
your eye i think you're just human
beings we are not desensitized to this
yet
so if you're walking around and you see
this you kind of can't look away if
you're at the right angle i feel like
it's just hard to ignore a [ __ ] lion
jumping out you know what i'm saying
like or a [ __ ] giant colossal pepsi
so eventually in 30 years will this all
be boring because every [ __ ] street
corner will have one of these but for
now it's uh innovative and i'm impressed
so it's a win for me um let me give a
fail oh yeah oh yeah i'm gonna give you
a fail all right so i pay for a service
that shows me basically trending new
commercials every week that have been
released by companies and i watch them
pretty regularly and most of them are so
bad they're not even worth like they're
just medium i don't ever bring them up
on this series but there's a new
campaign from subway that is the perfect
combination of
bad and expensive and desperate
that i thought i would show it if you
guys don't know a study came out
recently that claimed subway tuna is
zero percent fish like it's entirely
[ __ ] like i don't know paced it
caused a lot of bad pr they got sued and
they also got sued before that for like
being 11 inches and everything they said
foot long and just in general they've
been having declining same store sales
and uh subway which has more restaurants
than mcdonald's in america
is now starting to close some stores and
it's you know it's just having a rough
time so they're like doubling down and
spending a ton of money on a huge new ad
campaign to try and get yours back on
board and the idea of the ad campaign is
called there's so much to say we
couldn't fit it in one commercial and
i'm gonna just give you one example and
you're gonna see why i think this ad
campaign is really bad
but
we'll start right here
seductive
irresistible
yet forbidden
pretty
the new fragrance that says
subway has so much new it didn't fit in
their last hat so they bought time in
mind to talk about hearty multigrain
bread
freshly baked
smells so good
i can almost taste it
that's tom brady do you know how
[ __ ] expensive this ad must have been
now the whole concept is they have a
regular subway ad that runs before this
and then they follow it up with this ad
they buy two ad slots back to back and
then you think the second ad slot is
like a perfume ad but at the end they
say uh oh it actually was subway out all
along but the problem is our brains are
already pretty numb to this [ __ ] and we
pick up on what's going on in the first
few seconds okay and we've already coded
this ad in our brain as a tom brady
perfume ad in the first seven seconds
and then by the end of it it's not like
we're like thinking oh
but subway's great
we never catch up with why it's clever
or funny it's just a big [ __ ] waste
of time and money and at the end of the
day
you you fast forward 24 hours you've
completely it has left no memorable
imprint upon your brain and so i'm just
shocked their ability to buy double the
ad space to make an ad that's more
forgettable and expensive
with a big celebrity endorsement that
barely even shows the [ __ ] product
and they include a joke about he doesn't
even need bread so they picked tom bread
who doesn't even eat bread
they're talking about how great bread is
the the whole concept is terrible and i
swear to god for for food companies
especially fast food companies it's not
that hard literally show a picture of a
good looking sandwich say it's cheap say
it's good
and not expensive that works it's worked
for a long time you are not a luxury
item so all the way i i just i want to
put this on as a fail because i thought
it was
it was resoundingly you know one of the
worst ads i saw this uh this week all
right so now it's time for the final two
wins and fails of the week and they are
quite special because
they aren't wins at all in fact it's
just two fails in the great war between
apple and epic games i am pleased to
announce that both have lost
it somehow managed to be a result that
they both are unhappy with big win for
everyone who's hoping for both companies
to lose and i think in some ways we all
work in some ways none of us want to be
on the side of trillion dollar apple or
on the guys that made fortnite we kind
of wanted both companies to lose and so
they did and i'm gonna explain why we're
gonna go into it that's sort of the
topic for the next few minutes i'm gonna
explain what the hell happened what what
happened in this court case who won who
lost who's the real winner who's the
real loser okay because at the end of
the day we're not gonna accept the
result that both people watched somebody
had to lose more and i'll tell you who
lost more can you keep a secret i will
tell you
epic epic epic epic i said epic because
they both lost epic no everyone's saying
apple i'm sorry epic games lost more
[Laughter]
like buy a lot
like buy a lot
sorry it's not close epic games got
creamed in this
fortnight got owned apple was bigger and
stronger and more powerful with better
lawyers and they won and if uh you look
at it they really did uh they won on
like nine out of ten counts and the one
count they sorta lost on is gonna end up
being a pretty strong appeal for apple
so no it was not a big win for the free
fortnight community let's kind of rewind
here and explain what happened uh if you
guys don't know the lawsuit kicked off
when epic games who was sick and tired
of giving a massive cut a 30 cut of
everything they sold every v buck sold
on ios to apple created their own direct
payment service and they just installed
it into the app without telling apple so
when you logged on to buy v bucks you
could either pay 9.99 to apple or you
could use direct payment and get a
discount price apple of course freaked
the [ __ ] out this is against the rules
you have to give us our 30 cut and that
kicked off the entire lawsuit where epic
games claimed they had a monopoly they
said it's not fair we have to give you
30 cut we are big enough we don't need
to give you money to do app store
reviews our [ __ ] is not like a hacked
fake app all right you don't have to
barely even review our apps you didn't
even notice us adding this new payment
option so that was the big contingency
argument and uh epic came with 10
different counts of
antitrust and monopoly and and all of
those got struck down unfortunately the
main claim that the judge made i read
her entire ruling the main thing the
judge said was and this is really good
for sigma's out there success is not a
crime
so every time she said yeah it kind of
looks like apple does have monopoly
power here but success is not a crime
and so
unfortunately the judge was not really
keen on enforcing this kind of thing
even though the judge seemed to agree in
the ruling with almost all of the things
epic was pointing out success is not a
crime
and so uh apple would not get punished a
large part
oh
an unduly large part of the trial was
literally spent talking about what the
definition of a video game is which
it's a big [ __ ] waste of time but let
me get you some quotes here i'm sorry i
just need to pull
[Music]
okay
yeah apple's censoring me i swear to god
apple is censoring me they don't want me
to read the codes anyway i'm gonna tell
you
it's
way too much buildup for the quote okay
they brought an apple executive onto
stage i'm sorry on to the bench to
to address the court
on the definition of what he was like an
expert witness and what he said was it
is something that has a beginning middle
and end where you can get points the
stand
they brought him to the stand and he
said the beginning middle and end and
you can get points and that was their
definition of a game it was just one of
the many quotes that i thought were
baffling almost all of epic's uh um
points were shot down they were not
counted as a monopoly but the main thing
that did get through this is the one
pierce in apple's armor this is the one
thing that may cause them a lot of money
down the road the judge did say that
looking at all of the um contract
agreements of of apple to developers is
that there's a um a rule that apple has
if you make an app on apple store you're
not allowed to even tell your customers
they can use the web to buy it cheaper
so for example like if you want to
subscribe on twit like if you want to
subscribe to me on ios if you do it
through the twitch app on ios apple gets
a cut but if you just go to the web if
you go to twitch.tv in like safari
there's no cut okay so apple literally
has a rule that says you can't even tell
people that like you can't even hint at
it you can't send him an email you have
to keep that a complete secret
and that is extreme that's not even like
that makes no sense with their argument
of like we need to use it to like keep
our platform strong and like pay people
to review the ads that's just being a
monopoly that's just forcing people into
it's just shady the judge is like okay
you can't do that so that was like
that's that's like the big when everyone
says that epic one because everyone's
saying apple one epic one the reason
there's even a debate is because of that
one line that one line the judge is like
no you can't do that so from now on you
are legally allowed to have a button
that says a button or some sort of
pop-up or something says like you can go
to web
and and do this easier so for example if
you're in spotify and you want to pay
for spotify premium if you do it through
ios apple gets a cut but there'll
probably be a button or something that
says go to web go to safari and you can
you can can it be a link so that's the
thing apple is going to appeal this i
think and it's going to be a real
[ __ ] another back and forth battle
because apple does not want their
biggest apps pushing you to the web to
to get rid of the cut but here's the
thing this judge was such a bootlicker
dude honestly because even after all
this even if the judge is like yeah
that's shady as hell you can't do that
she's like
but
even if they push to the web and you
subscribe through there and there's no
apple cut apple theoretically could
still ask you for a cut like we're not
gonna stop that so literally they're
saying like even if you went to the
[ __ ] website and subscribed without
using the ios app store at all apple
would be within their legal rights
because you used an iphone to ask you
for a cut the thing is that's very hard
to enforce it would take like you know a
big team that apple doesn't want to
spend and like a lot of auditors and
follow-ups and
and so apple really does not want it to
get off the payment system because then
they'd have to actually follow up with
everybody so it reminds me see whether
they'll do that but they're within their
rights to still do that so literally the
judge like fully upheld apple's right to
take 30
there was really not a lot of pushback
on that front also the judge at the end
said and we were not able to determine
what constitutes a video game
they brought in multiple expert
witnesses and by the end of it they're
just like all right we just can't figure
it out and we don't need to we can't
figure it out there's no good definition
and we don't need to and you know what
they didn't need to but it's just stupid
they tried here's why epics lost so you
might be thinking why did epic really i
mean listen they got they got a little
bit of leeway with apple they got the
new button the reason epic games lost is
because at the end of this all even
though um the judge is like yes some of
the [ __ ] was shady she was also like
okay but at the end of the day when you
did this and violated your agreement
with apple
you broke a contract and there's nothing
more sacred in this court of law than a
contract so
at the end of the day you have to pay
apple 12 million dollars for violating
the contract because even if the rules
change it doesn't matter the rules
weren't changed when you broke it so you
had to make 12 million dollars and
that's that money doesn't matter that
much but apple is fully within their
right to ban you from the app store for
life
which they're doing so apple in response
to being sucked into this [ __ ] long
drawn out agreement
is continuing to keep epic games and
fortnite off the app store forever and
so fortnite mobile remains a no-go
there's just no way to stop it and so
that's a pretty much a massive l because
not only did epic games have to spend a
ton of [ __ ] money
on lawyers and legal fees and everything
for this trial they have to spend 12
million dollars to pay apple back for
violating contract and
they lost an estimated 100 plus million
from not having fortnite on ios and all
this time but before you get to um
invested in heroic tim sweeney here i
would like to read a quote from the
judge of this case so epic games made
the claim at one point that apple's
contract was unconscionable which means
it was one-sided enough to shock the
conscience and the judge said this is a
billion dollar company and a trillion
dollar company with a business dispute
none of this
involves the conscience
[Laughter]
and i thought that was a pretty good
quote but you know what at the end of
the day i don't really you know okay
important things about monopoly that'll
shape the future of business dynamics
yeah that's kind of interesting but
what's more important was the secret
trial the secret undercurrent of a trial
that was going on throughout the entire
app over his epic trial and that was the
trial to determine whether or not this
character could appear naked and i guess
what
peely can
so that's the real win peely can be free
and appear naked in court and the judge
did an official ruling on it as peely is
just a banana man he is fully capable of
appearing in court without wearing a
tuxedo as he originally was required to
do in the opening days of the trial
thank god for the justice system
thank god so you know what maybe
fortnite
wasn't freed on ios but its most
important character was free to be
himself to be the banana man he always
wanted to be

Berries, Cream, and the Collapse of the World Economy - YouTube
today's wins and fails is unique
because i have three wins that are kind
of small
and one fail that is very very very very
very very large
first win
is just this cute little ad that people
kept tagging me in i have seen almost
zero interesting truck ads
in my entire life and then i saw two in
this past week
it's this tomorrow war truck driving
around japan to promote the movie
you know it's definitely eye-catching
it's pretty clever probably wasn't too
expensive and uh and not only did it get
you know eyeballs in person but the most
important thing is it got a ton of
eyeballs online
in the same vein a funeral home
did a don't get vaccinated
slogan driving around i believe south
carolina i'm surprised their tires
didn't get [ __ ] slashed
uh i love trucking huge win based truck
month baby the future is truck
i'm gonna go to a marketing conference
get on stage
ladies and gentlemen
the future
is truck
raise my hand two trucks come on stage
behind me
next win
this is an easy win it's called fashion
fashion is what won this week because it
went forward a thousand years with the
release
of fortnite x balenciaga
this is a 600 pair of shades and i
believe a 1 000
shirt
and shield
brother
that's the coolest kids in school bar
none
so this is all part of a rise in luxury
brands trying to get into the digital
goods space
the main growth area for luxury bands in
the past five years has been china
recently
something we're going to talk about
later that might be in in calling the
question and so they are uh
they've always been looking into this
basement they're rapidly looking at
space more to find a new way to grow
revenue and that is digital goods so
they're crossing over with the biggest
place to sell digital goods which is
fortnite this is the beginning of what
people are calling the metaverse the
future the ideas that you'll have these
um you know the ability to buy digital
goods that we all just
tacitly consider to be just as valuable
if not more so than physical goods and
fashion in the digital realm for our
digital avatars
is going to be
where they make a majority of their
money
long story short if you don't have
fortnite x balenciaga gear you are poor
let's get to the final win and this is a
really important win like this win i
think to sum it up in one word is is
monumental
earth shaking
deserved and this one of course goes to
me
because a few months ago we did an ad
review where we watched the commercial
berries and cream
berries and cream patties and cream i'm
a little lad who loves berries and cream
berries and cream berries and cream all
the little ideas and cream
[Music]
this commercial is from 2007 i think
it's a great commercial by the way it's
from 2007.
then i watch it on screen say it's good
now as i recall a large portion of my
chatter said
what
i'm a zoomer i don't like this
this is some millennial [ __ ] there's no
way zoomers would like this flash
forward
less than three months maybe i think a
month and a half
it is like the most popular [ __ ]
sound on tick tock
which means yet again i was right
and as a [ __ ] whole most of chat was
colossally wrong
and stupid
basically if you want to know what
zoomers are gonna do in three months
watch my stream now okay because they're
gonna be doing that
maybe it's all gonna be cocaine and
mustard i don't know but that's where
it's going fingers on the pulse baby
fingers on the pulse now speaking of
fingers in the pulse in a more somber
way we're probably all going to die in
poverty
because let's get to my fail
over the weekend a chinese real estate
titan called evergrand
collapsed completely they had hundreds
of billions of dollars in debt due to
pay today that they have defaulted on
means they're not able to pay it and
they're telling the creditors they're
not going to pay it you guys know that
the chinese economy has been growing
rapidly over the past 10 15 years and
one portion of that of their giant
growth in gdp
has been real estate construction so
like if you're a small city in china you
can make more money just selling land to
real estate developers than um almost
any other way
and so every part of china was doing
this and it created what was called
ghost cities where there's like these
big shoddily made skyscrapers and
construction and stuff that no one was
actually living in but on the books it
was worth a lot of money a company like
evergrand which is a real estate
developer
was posting huge profits and was saying
they were worth more every year in fact
it is very rare for a company to
collapse after having the previous 20
quarters all be green i'll be positive
they said we're doing great we're doing
great we're doing great we're doing
great we're doing great we're doing
great oh we're broke
is this isolated to just evergrand the
data that i'm finding says no just as
just just today two more gigantic real
estate companies in china went down 80
90
they're also about to fail
and that begins a knock-on effect
because now mining companies that make
metals and things that might be used in
construction are also starting to fail
and now companies in the west like let
give you an example blackrock is one of
the biggest um investment firms in
america massively invested
in some of these chinese bonds so
they're starting to be uh a bit of what
we could call a global financial crisis
again this is similar what happened in
2007-2008
what's more scary is that on our side
our stock market is at absolute record
highs
and all of that has been fueled by easy
access to debt
the reason everything is so high right
now including me
am i right is because everybody has had
easy access to debt and the interest
payments are very low
once banks start to uh
take these big losses on the chin from
things like evergrand they start to
restrict access to credit and then
people that owe money can no longer
borrow money to pay their interest so
they start defaulting more and it causes
a bit of a snowball effect where soon
everything's collapsing and that's why
you may have noticed today that
everything was down
crypto was down stocks were down real
estate was down
everything was down lost three billion
dollars of doge oh i'm sorry i'm sorry
brother anyone who tells you they know
exactly how this is gonna play out is a
[ __ ] liar it is far too complex for
one human being
to know all the different domino
knock-on effects what i can tell you is
what we're hoping for to keep the gravy
train rolling
is for china to step in and bail out
these companies similar to what america
did in 2007 2008. the problem is
state media in china their biggest uh
newspaper
released a statement on friday
saying that evergrande is not too big to
fail implying they will let it fail
implying that we may be due
for some real
times
so what is particularly interesting
is that so much of crypto is owned and
mined in china
crypto is almost certainly at least for
the foreseeable short-term future going
way down
it is not going to the moon and i would
encourage you to not buy the dip but
again every time i say that
it goes up one dollar and someone goes
you idiot
if i had bought it at 4 98 yesterday
it's 499 today i would have made
millions if i bought a million shares
what i am worried about is if this does
continue for knock-on effects
everything is going to go down even safe
mode
well no obviously not safe moon
no say obviously safe moon is safe the
problem is when all the knock-on effects
come at the door and they come knocking
and they're like take you down to the
ground safe points at the sign safe and
they ah they have to walk away
what i'm trying to say is and again this
is not financial advice do whatever you
want
if you
have been waiting to get into a stock
let's say you're like really excited to
get into amazon stock or whatever well
tesla's a great example you're like ah
tesla's going to the [ __ ] moon i
can't wait to get in on the dip and you
see it dip a little bit
i would wait for a bigger dip because i
have a feeling
that the dip that we are about to see
could be
massive
so evergrand again this is the start of
all this is evergreen
they're a real estate company but back
in march they started to realize that
they were a few months away from being
totally broke
nobody knew yet
and what they did was create this
just capitalizing on the stupid amount
of hype in the market
ever grand electric vehicles
like a spin-off of the real estate
company
and they made a bunch of fake ev cars
none of these ever actually were
produced and guess what they raised
billions this company just the car
company was worth more than ford despite
never having made a single car
and most of that
was from western investors people in
america canada europe
buying in thinking that this was a great
idea
china electric vehicles let's go they
bought in it's worth nothing they used
the money to pay for their debts on the
real estate side and basically shuddered
how will this global collapse impact my
channel points they'll be more valuable
once that once um all currencies are
valueless
owning a bunch of atricoin channel
points will be
magnifique i don't know if you guys know
this but you actually get more atricoin
per minute when you're subbed
so you can convert your useless us
dollars into a sub
uh oh then start generating powerful
atricoin returns literally yesterday
this article went up
saying that
uh there's an outcry against
federal officials trading stocks
and we should have more accountability
and they should have to sell their
stocks it's very interesting that that
they're being forced to sell their
stocks right now
and what i'm noticing is if you compare
it to this chart this is when they did
all the buying no ethics outcry no other
excel credit no exactly
and then all of a sudden right about
here
there's an ethics outcry where they have
to sell but by the way if they sold
without this without this outcry
everyone would be like mad at them
they'd be like oh what the [ __ ] is going
on but if you pretend like oh i'm being
forced to oh i guess just to be to be
ethical i'll get rid of all my stocks
they're all doing that right now they're
getting they're dumping their positions
at the top and that to me is very very
suspicious
generally i want to give you guys
recession advice
if you graduate directly into a
recession that's bad
so if you're in college right now
try to be younger somehow try to be
younger okay
but if you're younger
usually at the recession it begins to
rebound and there's a period of growth
and that's actually a good time to
graduate and also you want to be um
entering your prime
earning years as things are really low
so when you buy things like a house
or stocks or whatever or your 401k
over the course of your life it'll go up
right now
the federal government is just printing
money to keep this artificially high so
that all the boomers who spent all their
life getting stocks and bonds and houses
can stay rich
that is basically what's happening you
kind of want some correction at some
point if there's no correction and
everything stays super high then it
becomes
like it is now where it's impossible to
afford a home it's it's impossible to
really get a foothold in the stock
market there's no way to grow value
because we're already at record highs um
and we don't know this is gonna play
everything's new here everything's
bigger and newer and different and more
globally connected than before i have no
idea
maybe this will be a slow [ __ ]
hindenburg maybe everything will [ __ ]
dip tomorrow maybe it'll go to the moon
even higher and then it'll crash
does the market keep crashing tomorrow
or is today the brunt of it
okay
no today was not the brunt of it
today was nothing today was a blip if
the market's actually going to crash
we're only like down a [ __ ] one
smidget from the top dude we're still at
the top
no no no no no no i don't know if you've
been listening but no
today if you want me to tell you
everything's fine
no yeah today was it yeah we're down a
percent or two and it's it's over
it'll it's all up from here it was a
tough day but we made it
we did it
wow we survived it we survived the 2021
great

How Gacha Games Trick Players Into Spending Thousands - YouTube
welcome to marketing monday today's
topic the psychological warfare of
gotcha games and the tricks they use to
part you from your money and how
they're being adopted as the future of
video games but first i want to start by
having you watch a very short video that
maybe illustrates the point i'm trying
to make here about
gotcha games
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
to be clear
one
triple a game
that took a studio hundreds of millions
of dollars to make
costs sixty dollars
this person bought
i don't know what seventy 70 divided by
60.
basically 1200 copies
i just want you guys to get a sense of
why business might be interested in this
kind of model okay that's the beginning
of this presentation
[Music]
[Music]
okay so that is an intro video let's
get into it
this is gaming revenue visualize for the
past 20 years 30 no
50 years of gaming okay
you might notice in the beginning
all gaming revenue came from arcades and
consoles
then we added the pc to the mix
in the late 80s then handheld comes a
bomb
and then right around 2000 okay right
around the millennium they start to add
mobile you might notice
mobile has gone from a little bit of
gaming revenue to 2007 to more than
everything else combined today mobile is
now bigger than pc and console and cloud
and vr combined how did they do that how
did mobile reach these [ __ ]
astronomical revenues so quickly they
have a more effective way of parting
consumers from their money and we are
starting to see that seep into all
aspects of aaa gaming
and that is why
i would like to take the time today to
sort of give you some defense to let you
understand some of the tricks that
marketers and game designers use to
separate you from your money
so i chose one game in particular to
kind of follow the story through this
applies to a lot of games but i chose
one in particular because i think it's
one of the best at it again [ __ ] the
beautiful
gorgeous world we see here of gentian
impact
is essentially
a far more predatory casino
it's the first truly triple a gotcha
game now a lot of these gotcha mechanics
we're going to talk about have been
around in various forms across mobile
for a long time gentry back is not just
on mobile it's a aaa game across
consoles and pc and it takes all of
these powerful psychological principles
strips away all of like the annoying
spammy ad stuff and puts it in an
actually fun to play beautiful game and
so it has removed all the barriers that
were stopping people before from getting
sucked into these kind of worlds and
that's why it's been phenomenally
successful it made a billion dollars i
think in this past year
more than that actually more than a
billion dollars in like its first year
of play
what makes it a gotcha is you cannot say
i want that and just buy it
everything you want is behind some sort
of lottery system that adds excitement
and additional length to the game let's
show you some more examples of the money
they make these are five of the recent
characters released in kitchen impact
and the amount of money they made in a
single day 15 million for song lee 9
million for albedo 14.8 million and gone
this is one day
okay adding up to billions so now let me
get into some of the uh
some of the psychological tricks that
they use okay that i want you to be
ready for number one
a bonus for first time sign ups you're
gonna see this a [ __ ] lot this is
when you first get into the game
they will give you some kind of bonus
some kind of double gems the reason they
do this is because once you've put in
payment information the friction for
everything else that they're going to
try to trick you with is drastically
reduced let's say you're like oh i want
that skin
having to go to your wallet and pull out
the [ __ ] credit card and type it in
and figure that out is a stop moment
psychologically it's like a stop it's a
big pit of friction they have to get rid
of that okay the first spend is the
hardest
and i saw a video by a game developer
describing it as like an icebreaker and
they said quote they only think of
themselves as spenders
once they've broken the ice once you
break that wall you break them
that is a quote
once you break that wall you break them
so
the next thing they'll do is battle
passes battle passes or any kind of
format that requires
daily logins or regular play time they
will offer their best deals their best
you know gems to dollars or whatever
whatever v bucks to dollars whatever it
is whatever the value is will be best in
the battle pass because the goal is to
make the game part of your daily routine
once you do this for 20 plus days it is
now officially a habit in your brain
that is difficult to break
next thing they'll do and this was
baffling i mean listen i've seen this
before in other games gen [ __ ] impact
took it to another [ __ ] level the
idea of this
is to have so many different
currency types and tokens and weird
denominations things are bought in to
make it so your brand cannot easily map
out how much you're actually spending
and what gentry does is has genesis
crystals primo gems intertwined fate a
quiet fate star glitter star dust and
more
you buy primo gems turn them into fate
to turn them into star glitter to roll
for stardust it's all way to make it
confusing so you can't tell how much
dollars you're spending and not only do
they have different currencies but
they'll have different denominations so
that's why things will be costed like
143 primo gems it needs to be fun money
it needs to put it into the gym form and
then it's from there it's fun money for
you and you just spend it without really
knowing the value another thing they do
is they highly incentivize social proof
people and this is more of a human
psychological principle people are much
more likely to not share their losses
and happily share their wins youtubers
now upload videos saying i lost money on
kitchen and back they upload the video
of their rare poll and that creates a
false heuristic in your brain that the
odds of it are higher than they actually
are you are more likely to think it's
possible when you see other people
getting it let me give you a direct
quote here this is a direct quote again
from a game developer that makes mobile
games
do not tell your players that the
majority of people do not spend money
that is cancer that will kill your
monetization that is a [ __ ] direct
quote
do not tell them that people don't spend
money that is cancer whatever you do if
you spend money in a game other players
should know about it and that
incentivizes them to think okay they're
doing it i can do it too that's how
social proof works okay they also are
more direct for example in ginger impact
they had a promo where if you took an
in-game photo of your rare pull like if
you pulled a rare hero and took a photo
of it you got free primo gems
so you were incentivized to tell and to
take a photo and share your friends that
you got
something cool which makes you think
that it's [ __ ] going work and again i
think an example here
youtubers again always sharing their
insane luck lambie's insane luck
insanely lucky flamingo gotcha pools
and if you look on youtube this is
there's millions of these people sharing
their insane luck
in polling um and and it's just just to
open the air to clear the air i am 100
guilty of this i have spent hundreds of
dollars before i had any back when i was
broke in college hundreds of dollars on
lol skins and that's the big that's not
even really a gotcha mechanic yet but
but again
wall skins is baby food compared to what
games have gotten good at today with
psychological warfare that's that's
level one
okay that's like pretty easy to get
around i just have a weak mind but if i
was impressionable and playing gentian
impact there is so much more than that
and the fact is if i wanted that skin
and couldn't buy it directly but had to
buy
60 packs or 60 pulls to get a shot at
getting it and then do it again to level
it up that's where it starts to get
crazy that's where they are really
taking advantage of the skinner box
nature of our minds this is a video i'd
like to show you
called let's go whaling tricks for
monetizing mobile game players with free
to play against the ceo of a mobile
gamecube remind you that
the best way
to
make sure of both your
retention and your monetization is to
make sure you have enough
of an in-game economy in there
the thousand up there is
actually clearly lowballing it
top grossing games have in-game
economies worth tens of thousands that's
how you can
keep people in there they have lots of
things to do to to stuff to upgrade to
progress along and that's how you can
can make them them spend a lot as well
since you can for instance uh give a
huge discount on something you know
basically what he's saying
is that you need to be able to get uh
like if you're a new whale to a game
there better be a thousand plus dollars
of things you can spend your money on
the days of games having like relatively
small
level of pay to win like horse armor for
two dollars are completely gone okay if
you want to you should have no end
according to the game players of the
amount of things you can spend your
money on it should be tens of thousands
a hundred thousand there should be you
should be able to spend your money over
and over and over again on a variety of
different things so let me give you an
example here
from gentian impact you may notice that
the hero is something you can pull that
can go up to five stars but also all of
their items and weapons can be pulled
that go up to five stars so every time
you play this game there is an infinite
different number of directions that you
can be uh spending money trying to level
up one thing they never ever want is for
you to be like okay i finally got it
there's no amount of money that can get
you perfection in this game and there's
constantly adding more to make sure that
it's not the case another thing they do
they gotta fairly frequently change the
meta in some way so that different
characters are more valuable so that
somebody that says has a perfect lineup
for one character now feels like oh so i
need to continue to level up someone
else the idea is to make it so you can
never you can never feel like you've
you've finished um helpful to this
business model that when they release a
new champion that champion generally is
good
that's helpful for their sales now this
is one of my favorite most interesting
slides this is the four types of players
that you are targeting let's say we're
all let's say we've all started um
atriox chat mobile game company we're
all gonna get rich okay we're gonna
start a [ __ ] devious mobile game
company to make billions when we make
our mobile game there are four players
to look out for the killers the
achievers the socializers and the
explorers let me explain what they are
the killers want to win and they will
spend anything to beat other people they
are the most likely to fall for pay to
win type mechanics
i
am a video game and my killer the
biggest thing i ever spent money on was
hearthstone cards because i wanted to
people on ladder
i was playing the ladder i would lose to
a rare card and think [ __ ] you i could
beat you if i had that card and then i
would buy it
um the next we have socializers people
that want to have a good time with
friends okay this is the most common
explorers they like novelty they like
new content they like seeing new things
and achievers
their main goal is progress they want to
be the best they want to complete their
collection they want to five-star every
item they want to feel they want to fill
that hole in their soul
by by having this completion you know
they like progress progress is very
important filling up meters bars now let
me explain how
you make money from all four of these
people
for the killers
you sell competitive advantage this is
what you do this is how games like clash
of clans make a lot of money this is how
like
hearthstone makes its money competitive
advantage and this is what works on me
okay
then
for socializers which is most people
you sell customization that's skins
flexing and uniqueness
people want to feel like they stand out
like they're unique do they have
something different that draws the
attention of the eye customization if
you play with your friends a lot for fun
you are most likely to buy that new
valerie gun skin but what's surprising
in my research is that this is not where
the money comes from they make money off
this to be sure but it turns out that
people just buying skins directly is
only a small part
of the truly
large gotcha game economy next up is
explorers to make them happy you have to
give them content yuck
our mobile game company can't afford
that we can't afford to actually add new
levels new maps that's expensive that's
work so how do we make that fat juicy
juicy profit
that my friend is the achievers and how
do we make money off them convenience
this is where
the big
whale mamma jamma top dog
convenience being able to cut down on
the grind being able to get something
quicker than everyone else that is where
you can get absolutely massive amounts
of money and in fact for example in a
game like clash of clans this is 80 of
their income it's from targeting these
achievers this is where the whales live
if you are in the achievers zone you are
most susceptible to becoming a whale you
need to be the most careful when
entering a mobile game
they want you bad so some of the ways
they do that let me let me show you one
of the psychological principles they
exploit is called loss aversion and that
is the idea that people are more afraid
of losses people hate losing more than
they love winning i explained this in a
previous marketing monday actually we're
talking about when they gave someone a
free gift like people were exiting a
study or a survey
and they they asked them
how much do you think this trinket is
worth this little random [ __ ] trinket
if they didn't give it to him they all
said it was worthless or worth like two
bucks but if they gave him the trinket
and said it's yours how much do you
think it's worth they all said five
bucks seven bucks ten bucks once they
owned it they said it was worth double
triple quadruple than they what they
would have said before that okay so
people once they own something have a
feeling a sense of loss and so mobile
games do they gotcha games use this
method a lot
by making you think you've earned
something and saying you could only
complete it when you've paid for example
if you are halfway through a mission and
you run out of moves or out of lives
they will threaten you with losing all
your progress if you don't spend money
for example this one's really egregious
oops the balloon got through and ran out
of lives don't let them undo your hard
work
continue with bonus
and that's that's the psychological
principle and uh a great example is uh
actually one of the most devious
examples i've seen is puzzles and
dragons if you guys ever played that
game when you're doing some kind of
dungeon and puzzles and dragons you will
earn
items and [ __ ] on the way but if you
don't complete the mission or whatever
they don't give you those items they'll
show them to you and say you've earned
these you've got these do you want them
you have to finish the level though so
you have to spend money next up we got a
limited time offers now if you guys have
ever read the book thinking fast and
slow it's a great book i would recommend
checking it out but the main idea is
that our brain has two systems system
one and system two system one is our
basic monkey brain that we use for most
things day-to-day life if i were to ask
you what's uh 15 times 34
you are capable of solving that but you
can't solve it quickly so you have to
get that lazy slow but smart part of
your brain to wake up our brain hates
using system 2. system 2 is what we need
to use to make smart choices but we hate
using it and one of the ways to ensure
we always use system 1 is to put us
under time pressure next thing is the
ikea effect okay the ikea effect states
we love things more if we felt like we
were part of the creation if we felt
involved in making them we think it's
worth a lot more than it is so even a
shitty table from ikea generally has
more uh warmth in it if you built it
yourself
the way games use it is they will do
things like um they will make you feel
like you did some work
they will give you a randomized reward
based on some amount of effort like
let's say you plant a crop and then it
grows and then you get something special
any kind of randomized reward that you
feel like you earned is is a very strong
psychological hook just doing some kind
of effort and then getting a randomized
reward and if you combine those two
things it's very easy to create a loop
where they're hooked very quickly next
they have a bunch of fallacies now i
couldn't fit these on different slides i
did not describe them
gambler's fallacy is the most common and
i'll explain that real quick it's
basically the thinking that you are more
likely to hit a roll because you didn't
hit it last time
which by and large is not true they have
some pity rules in some of these games
that apply over 100 plus roles or 90
plus roles but in general the idea is
like i rolled i didn't get it now i'm
more likely and uh it's a big thing that
gotcha games rely on because once you've
already spent money you feel like okay
now i'm due now i'm owed i've gotten the
bad luck out of the way now the good
luck is here and that is of course not
how it works it also applies the sunk
cost fallacy sun costs the same thing so
i kind of mix those two together here
but uh sunk cost is whenever you've
already put time or money into something
you uh value that higher than you should
and you you want to follow up that you
follow up the bad money with more bad
money basically
you're conor
sub yeah
yeah
or or your age rocks up oh i'm a 12
month a truck stop i actually [ __ ]
hate the guy but i've i've been here for
12 months what am i going to do
perfect example perfect example okay i
want to show you one of the scariest
quotes from again let's go whaling and
this quote made me so sad
for the future of games
uh remember there are four ways of
progressing in in games in general you
can have a skill game based game you can
have a lock based game you can have a
game where you just progress by grinding
or you can pay
to uh to progress
make sure that your games aren't too
skill based i made that mistake myself a
two skill based game you
don't get people to pay for pay you
because there's no reason to
so make sure grinding and paying
are legitimate versions of progressing
in the game
oh no
oh no
and that's that's an audience of game
developers listening to a game developer
made a bunch of money
the truth is he tried a skill-based game
it doesn't make as much money people
don't like to compete on skill they
would like to compete on luck
time invested and money spent they
prefer a world where either they can put
a lot of time in to get better they can
spin a wheel to get better or they can
throw the credit card down they do not
want to actually have to get better
because psychologically that is
seemingly baked into our brains it's
gonna be tough for games to go
to not go in the direction of making
more money these ways so
that is one of the most damning and sad
things i think about the gotcha game
future now again i i i have money i'm a
whale i will spend
money uh but uh i will always miss games
like melee games like cs cs 1.6 themed
games like starcraft games that really
were only about skill-based progression
now do i think they're gone for good
absolutely not the cool thing about the
pendulum is that as the market shifts
towards one way
the few people remaining on the other
side that make skill-based games will
get all of the attention and i think a
few questions lastly i wanted to say um
do you guys remember that video i showed
at the beginning of the guy that spent
seventy thousand dollars on fate grand
order i know that a lot of you are
thinking this is so sad this is so
cringe this will never be me
i want you to know that we are only at
the beginning of the way these tricks
are being deployed across all games and
once they catch you slipping once they
can get you more and i found a couple
quotes from the comments of that video
that i thought were interesting this
person named depression said when i
first saw this video two years ago i
thought
i would never play this game let alone
pay for micro transactions well things
didn't turn out that way
when i first time i saw this i was like
loser and here i am four months later
into the game greetings fellow masters i
just finished babylonia
me who watched the video two years ago
that's insane i would never do that me
today a fake grand order whale
understandable have a nice day so i want
you to pour one out for these fallen
soldiers and remember that we are all
human beings
and and our moments of weakness are very
susceptible to algorithms and
corporations that have designed these uh
advanced skinner boxes took us in
uh and that's marketing monday
on the rise and scariness of gotcha
games
uh i hope you guys enjoyed that's
basically what i got for today
you
The Most Hated Brands in Every Country - YouTube
um now we get into the main marketing
monday which is the most hated brands in
the world now this is a mini marketing
monday but basically i have a map
that we're gonna look at here of the
most hated brand in every country this
was measured by negative comments about
the brand on social media that's what it
was okay for example
one of the consistently most hated
brands in the entire country is comcast
people people that actually use the
product consistently hate it because
it's a dominant monopoly that
overcharges and under delivers on
service but comcast is not on this list
because people don't complain too much
on social media
they just actually hate the company what
do you think the most hated brand in
america is
no the answer is uber
uber is the most hated brand in america
canada sony
canadians complain about sony more than
any other brand on social media taiwan
hates tesla based i
south korea hates youtube
china hates porsche
russia hates paypal
uh but you'll notice the the number one
worldwide
is sony
and so i looked into it and it's most
people just complaining about the
defective sony product they got or some
bad sony product so let me give you an
example but high up in the united states
is lego lego is one of the quote unquote
most hated brands due to this
methodology
and it's because people on social media
were writing that they stepped on legos
negatively
that was it
lego's actually a beloved brand but
because people were like legos i stepped
on one it got so many negative posts
that it was ranked as one of the most
hated brands so again this is not the
greatest methodology but it's a general
gist for who's getting talked about
who's getting talked you know brazil
hates red bull
which i thought was shocking and again
just the amount of sony's you see around
around the country
finland hates ferrari i guess they are
kind of like
ferrari seems like not what finland is
about
finland is all about like egalitarian
uh low wealth gap
i feel like if you were to ride around
in a ferrari in finland people would
think you're the world's biggest douche
bag you do not fit in in like this flat
society is amazon only hated in one
country that's germany that's actually
crazy kind of powerful of germany to
stand up to amazon
amazon is actually in america the number
one most loved brand there's a score
called the nps which is your net
promoter score which means you're how
likely you are to recommend this service
to someone else after you've used it and
amazon is number one the methodology for
this map is a little bit whack but for
nps it's very reliable and it's actually
one of the best preachers of how strong
a brain is how much money you're going
to make
everyone look for your state and see the
most hated brands if you agree with it
so i'm noticing california it's uber
which is funny that we quote unquote
hate uber even though like there was a
chance to finally make them pay their
workers
and they just spent a little money and
made some ads and everyone voted the
wrong way and uber got off scot-free
mississippi hates chanel
[Laughter]
north dakota hates espn that's that's
wild to me but i assume it's because
they're heavy users of espn if i'm being
honest north dakota hating espn is
probably like uh
the athletes aren't standing for the
flag
or espn they didn't show the game i
wanted to watch it's not like espn you
know i don't like their service it's
like they're doing something that pisses
me off in the moment
alaska hates starbucks
really
are there starbucks in alaska i assume
so there's gotta be
wouldn't you want or need coffee with a
16 hour night virginia hates huawei
that type
[Laughter]
virginia's got oh you know what
this might be because huawei like made a
fake factory i think didn't huawei have
that deal that they were gonna quote
unquote bring a bunch of jobs to america
and then made a bunch of essentially
fake
factories and empty
they bought a bunch of office buildings
and filled them with like
four employees just to fill the exact
terms of the agreement so they could
still fulfill the contract they made to
bring
quote bring jobs to get the break the
next one's more up or alley cause it's
about gaming brands most hated gaming
brands and i wanna see if you guys can
guess
we're gonna start with canada what do
you think canada's most hated brand is
in gaming game freak
creators of pokemon and that's also in
the united states you know what i
figured out what this is people only
mention game freak negatively i look
this up
if you say pokemon you're happy if you
say game freak you are almost certainly
mad no one has ever said good job game
freak if they say game freak they
hate you they're always mad i looked up
so here's an example i i did some
research here i looked at almost i just
looked at all the game freak posts and
they're all negative and they're always
like the developer but here's an example
of one that would be classified as
negative and it's a guy
i guess cosplaying as a pokemon
who said god damn it i just heard a
rumor i'm not gonna be in pokemon
legends arceus [ __ ] nintendo and
game freak
with a broken switch
game freak when people ask if they can
do actual sounds it's just all negative
about game freaking their choices
these [ __ ] that game freak when
you want to make the worldwide game the
iron curtain of ubisoft is hated across
all of europe and i think that's pretty
pretty accurate
where's ea it's crazy ea's not on here
and i don't know what to say about that
other than it can't be 100 accurate
because
it's probably also you had a figure like
ea
has fifa right ea is fifa and madden and
that's a lot of people who aren't part
of like what you consider the gamer
block
that are always bitching about like star
wars battlefront oh fast food brands
okay now this is pretty common this is
actually this is probably the most
accurate one because people talk about
fast food on social media a lot there's
not much you can debate on social media
without people getting too mad and fast
food and like pineapple on pizza are
like the two things uh united states bro
this is gotta because people complaining
about deliveries it's gotta be uh but
it's dominoes
dominoes in the united states orange
julius in canada which i actually first
time i agree with canada because orange
julius is where i got arrested in
atlanta
when i was trying to steal the orange
julius wi-fi in that mall
china hates subway
which is just a declaration of war
really taco bell who's saying mexico
hates taco bell
that makes so much sense
all right quote unquote mexican food
company founded by a white guy named
glenn bell
who made basic ass tacos taiwan pizza
hut philippines pizza japan taco bell
bro the reason japanese taco bell is
because it's so bad there
i had taco bell in japan and in korea
they make it different it's like they
don't have cheese or something i'm not
sure what it is
but they make it different and it tastes
way worse what is canada hey orange
julius any canadians want to tell me
quack
chime in why does canada hate orange
julius it's not good
quacks twitter a hundred france on
orange julius dominoes and dominoes in
italy is really funny
it's funny seeing taco bell being hated
in mexico and domino's being hated in
italy
that's actually that's actually fire
dude
if i had to say globally what's the most
hated i feel like people people [ __ ]
talk burger king more than anyone else
in my mind but i could be wrong nobody
uh gasses up burger king you know what
i'm saying people will say like
positive things about everything else
here
i've never heard people always eat
burger king begrudgingly similar to
genji and impact if you expect dog [ __ ]
there's something to complain about
yeah i guess
i guess that's true it's like who's
going into a bird king and expecting
greatness and then getting on social
media being like i was so disappointed
today
i went in for my classic whopper that i
know is all-time great burger
and it was only mid
oh there is tech brands although tech
brands is literally we can go this one
quickly
tech brands tech brands is almost all
microsoft probably windows complaints if
i had to guess
they say facebook is also huge
hashtag delete facebook was trending and
people try to get it canada hates
facebook which is based
um tech brands yeah it's google
microsoft facebook basically across the
entire globe
not a lot of variety here it's basically
the four big tech brands of the world so
the actual most hated brand in the world
could be nestle and i think primarily
it's because
globally they are major uh
exploiters of natural resources
um
and water access they bribe
or otherwise coerced local governments
into giving them access to water rights
and then resell that same water back to
the country at large markups
they also
do extremely degenerate things
like degenerate's not even the right
word despicable things
convincing mothers in developing
countries they should use nestle formula
for their baby rather than breast milk
like they shouldn't they shouldn't feed
their own baby they should use nestle
formula and try to make that
they actually run like pr campaigns to
make it seem like it's unhealthy to not
use
sugary nestle formula
they specifically gave people a free a
month of free formula so that mothers
wouldn't be able to provide their own
milk anymore yeah it's crazy they also
have child labor for chocolate
production so the cocoa beans they use
to make nestle chocolate is often
the product of child labor and abuse
over a 12 month period water pollution
limits were breached
2152 times at nestle factories these are
limits they agreed to and they breached
2 000 times in one year during the
height of a famine sweeping ethiopia
they tried to force ethiopia pay them
a 6 million dollar debt
when ethiopian government was dead broke
and there was a famine
nestle demanded a 6 million debt which
is nothing to nestle and everything to
ethiopia nestle makes a billion dollars
a year
on 29 different brands by the way if you
don't know what nestle makes it's pretty
massive the amount of things they own
here's an example nest t san pellegrino
uh perrier hot pockets
uh drumstick dryers ice cream kitkat
all this [ __ ] is under nestle nestle's a
huge conglomerate nestle claims to be
the world's leading nutrition health and
wellness company
when asked to make their cereal more
healthy they basically changed nothing
slapped the logo saying whole grain
guaranteed
and it's the exact same
sugary cereal
but now it's whole grain guaranteed
so you know it's healthy i'm just gonna
go through the uh
the top five here
and i think this is a more accurate way
of determining um hated companies all
right
number five most hated company in
america ea
this is based on people that use it this
is more like an nps type score ea
number five number four
university of phoenix online
a for-profit college these are scores
people that actually use the products
right so it's not social media it's like
people that have used the product
people that spend money
to go to university phoenix often feel
cheated by the education they receive
and their ability to get a job after
graduation they feel like they've been
scammed out of their money and it makes
them very angry
uh number three
this is funny
this is probably for similar reasons to
what we talked about earlier the nfl the
nfl is one of the most hated brands now
again it's similar to gamers where we'll
say we hate ea and then buy their games
people will say they hate the nfl and
everything they've done to football over
the past few years and then watch every
game and this is largely i think in
probably political divisions and maybe
changes to the sport to make it more um
you know probably less concussions
and the people were pissed that like
this is a baby game now
number two fox entertainment group has
one of the lowest net promoter scores
people generally outside of i guess the
hardcore fans have a very low perception
of the fox brand and again this all
comes from something there's large
divisions in the country
that cause extreme negative feelings
about one brand or the other fox at
number two and then number one and i'm
surprised by this but this is again this
is based on actual customer interviews
employee satisfaction detail analytics
yeah i mean this all seems real number
one is equifax
there was a massive hack and data breach
that didn't affect me so i didn't care
about it maybe it caused a lot of people
a lot of trouble i guess if all people
know about it is that they had a
terrible data breach
they don't have a very strong brand
so i could see that i personally my
number one based on things that i've
seen is comcast comcast and generally
cable companies in general are
universally hated almost everyone that
has to regularly use a cable company
dislikes them
they're a service they have to pay for
and they don't like and i found that to
be
they are the only brands that could have
that low of a score and stay in business
because they have a total monopoly cable
companies are the epitome of like what
are you gonna do
we're the only game in town at most
places like you're going to complain
online like what is your plan
we'll close with this this came from my
researcher
this is a campaign
by nestle
because they've gotten some hot water
over the uh
baby formula stuff where they were like
tricking mothers into using formula and
uh
they made this campaign
[Music]
you know what my theory i can't watch
anymore this is absolutely awful you
know what i think it is because nestle's
a devious company is it possible this is
a reverse ad to make breastfeeding seem
worse
is it possible that they were getting
fined for their underhanded content and
now they're like okay fine we'll make an
ad for breast milk to bring it back and
they made the worst possible ad they
could ever make you want all my masks to
have super babies
i can't believe this is real
boils and goals that is the end of
marketing monday that is the most hated
brand nestle and comcast we're landing
on i think we can agree on that nestle
comcast

Peanut Butter Marketing Has Gone Too Far - YouTube
welcome to marketing monday today we
have some wins and fails and then our
topic on marketing monday before that we
have to get to our wins and fails this
ad
is a fail
uh this is from jarvis
who found this
it is a brand new approach to mobile
game ads that just said i'm gonna be
fired if you don't try this game which
is sad
just depressing okay i'm not
i don't want the ad to depress me and if
you are gonna be fired you should have a
little bit more of a fire under your ass
to make a better ad than whatever the
[ __ ] this is
also
i'm not even kidding like i actually
think this is a bad ad i think any time
you try to guilt trip people it's
usually pretty ineffective the most
effective of all time was probably the
aspca arms of an angel dying animals
thing and even that like even with dying
animals and a song at their side most
people they see that they go oh that's
so sad and then they they change the
channel
okay so not very effective and i feel
bad for the guy but you probably did get
fired
uh let's see that was a fail though we
need to follow that up with a dub
this is a well earned dub
to jif peanut butter i was now people
tagged me in ads now on twitter i don't
i rarely use twitter actually like once
a month but people will tag me in ads
and this guy said hey truck you seeing
this [ __ ]
and so i looked
the copy is peanut butter more like
peanut banger
hashtag that jiffing good
little gif project and they paid a
substantial sum of money to get this
emoji getting these emojis on twitter is
very expensive so let's see what this
six second ad is that they spent so much
money on to get there
like i guess they paid for ludicrous as
well
and they're at a sort of club where
everybody is waving around jif peanut
butter spoons
and drinking ice water
that's the most unrealistic part of this
is that they're on a club with four tall
glasses of ice water
oh no this is not a win i'm sorry i call
it a witness joke this is dog [ __ ]
have they done more than this damn they
really went all in on luda huh
get a taste of the new flow
this is so weird because luna's
popularity was like peaked in 2002 and
three and now they're all in on like a
hip-hop themed luna based rebrand
for peanut butter
flexin
squeezin believe it
okay wait wait wait you can't see this
the spotify commercial is terrible the
sound of him eating peanut butter is
unsettling and cringe come on guys
we value the opportunity to receive your
honest feedback tyler and we'll
certainly relay your comments to our
team
you imagine you gotta go in that [ __ ]
boardroom uh so actually i guess we're
at two fails which i really need to
counter out so hopefully there's been
some wins this week i promise you we can
bring it back now i promise you we're
gonna get a win right now because
mcdonald's mcdonald's hit it big this
week
with a brand new
logo
wow
and a hilarious tweet hi welcome to
mcdowell's with the capital oh
oh what a [ __ ] brilliant concept and
all they had to do
i graduated college this is what it came
from by the way this is this is not a
joke you know okay here's what happened
i'm gonna tell exactly what happened so
about a year ago about a year ago today
you guys know this this guy i can't play
the sound because it's copyright he
start he made that he brought that song
back to popularity huge tic tac trend
this guy just was like vibing to a
classic 70s track holding ocean spray
and ocean spray saw this tick tock and
moved very fast they bought him a truck
they got him in an ad and they sold a
ton more juice so they they they
capitalized on a ticket that was
trending and turned into a big idea that
was good marketing it was very quick
moving marketing ever since then because
that worked once corporations have been
trying and failing it and so mcdonald's
which is a year late and slow and bad
saw this tick tock i graduated college
with a degree in design have been re
i've had some companies like mcdonald's
reach out to me and ask for a new logo
for obvious reasons
so here are my redesigns
the next victim was doritos your logo
feels aggressive to me
and i don't want my mom to look at it so
i softened your logo up a little bit the
readability is much nicer the way that i
chose the font
and then you guys also needed a tagline
because i don't know anything about how
your chips taste
so i added a tagline too for you the
last victim is mcdonald's
i don't think you meant for your logo to
look suggestive but right now this looks
like two knees to me i don't want to be
thinking about knees while i'm eating my
mcchicken instead of emphasizing the m i
put emphasis on the o instead i was
thinking this would be a really nice
campaign to get some onion rings to pair
nicely with your new logo let me know
who i should help next
okay so that you know it's a
maybe it's not my cup of humor but
it did pretty well on tick tock and
mcdonald's said
yes queen
the [ __ ] end of that 45 second tick
that is what we should base our entire
brand on the world should know about
this and so they [ __ ] went all in and
someone thought this is [ __ ] genius
even though mcdonald's has like a
[ __ ] million stores
billions of burgers sold customers who
don't use tick tock at all
and they went all in on it it's crazy
and they thought it was gonna be super
[ __ ]
clever and like get people on their side
and be like a wendy's moment they're
like relatable to the kids it's it's
it's baffling
it really is baffling for such an iconic
brand to even think this would be funny
for a minute
the rules of the internet state when a
brand joins in with the meme the meme is
dead yeah
that's generally true of all cases but
if they had just replied and said like
you know lmao or senator some free fries
that's one thing
even [ __ ] even [ __ ] ocean spray
didn't change their logo to a [ __ ]
skateboarder do you know what i'm saying
like there's a you can you can go in a
little bit you don't go all [ __ ] in
you don't [ __ ] make it your profile
picture a bad way to start um let's see
if i can finally bring it out of this
tailspin it's a negative
spiral that we're in there's got to be
something that good that happened in
this past week
oh
so this is sort of relevant to um last
week's marketing monday which is about
gotcha games and the tricks they use get
people to spend more they had an
anniversary event recently apparently
they were so stingy it was like the
stingiest anniversary event they've ever
had they gave out absolutely nothing for
free and required you to pay a lot of
money to get anything
and players got so furious that the
developer uh mihoyo was trending number
one worldwide for like the entire day
but it was all negative they're already
getting milked for
cash at every possible percentage every
player that game
is like part of a skinner box to be
parted with their cash
so that's a fail but i'm sure come on
there's got to be something come on oh
yeah
oh yeah i got a good one
this is a win
you can't call us anything but a win
okay you know how like in life sometimes
you'll make a big terrible mistake
and you have to finally learn to put
that behind you and move on well this
week
i want to give the first win to cd
projekt rhett
who is hiring for a new open world game
let's go
you got to cut your losses bro
you ain't fixing that game
gamers we all need to salute because
we're going to buy it and pre-order
we're also going to demand it comes out
by christmas the year after it's allowed
announced because we need it out fast so
i want to see some crunch
okay uh
that was honestly more of a fail but
we're gonna call that a win oh here's a
win here actually no this is a fail this
is a fail on all my friends in college
because this guy hit [ __ ] gold in
league of legends and had a [ __ ]
party where they baked him a cake
with my duo in ballarat today
by the way quack hit gold today and i
made fun of him on stream
okay and i was [ __ ] grinding for
diamond in league of legends and no one
threw me a [ __ ] party they just
stopped inviting me to parties because i
played too much league of legends the
the fail this week is
whoever the chinese version of atrialk
is
china just banned kids from basically
watching streams and streaming
themselves uh they've already banned if
you guys know a week or two ago they
banned
people under uh 16 from even playing
video games outside of three hours a
week one hour on friday
one hour on saturday and one hour on
sunday this is real they have put in
pretty extreme
um facial recognition uh checks so you
can't like easily get around it like
most other bands so it's actually having
a serious impact on a number of players
at that age and they followed it up with
with because i guess people that
couldn't play would start to watch
streams i mean you got to imagine
imagine that dude imagine if you if like
the west
banned kids from playing games the
amount of viewership on twitch would
[ __ ] quadruple
so that's a big l for chinese patriarch
and i'm sorry man you can no longer farm
chinese psychic for content
oh no
what the [ __ ] is chinese detroit gonna
do if he doesn't have children to farm
for content on his chinese reddit and so
i'm very sorry to hear that bro i'm
sorry to hear that and i hope you figure
out something new to do i don't know um
all right final one final win and fail
and then i guess we will do the most
hated brands and that of course goes to
nintendo
i haven't been able to talk about
nintendo's direct
because i was banned there can be no
bigger win
than them announcing the cast to the new
mario movie and i will just play my new
favorite clip on twitch to sort of sum
it up
talking a lot in the movie
please look forward to mario as
performed by the very talented chris son
next princess peach will be played by
anya taylor joy
i can't wait to see a very spirited
princess peach
mario's little brother luigi will be
played by charlie day
i'm excited for you to see this bro they
all sorted out seth rogen and [ __ ]
keegan michael key as toad
here's a clip i actually have an
exclusive first leak clip from the movie
hey ron
where are you
where is aaron right now
here
oh yeah
well why didn't you have me the first
time i said huh huh you know i'm just
asking you i said it like four times so
why didn't you say it the first time i
said aaron
because it's pronounced aaron
you know listen i don't hate every one
of these casting choices i think chris
pratt as mario
bro haven't we had enough of chris pratt
can we i'm [ __ ] done with chris pratt
chris bratt was funny in parks and rec
and then he became a mega star out of
nowhere and they made him the lead in
literally everything for like 10 years
and now i'm done
a mario it's a me
a mario it's a me
a mario it's a no
no no
mario it's a me bro no that's so bad
mario bro he's almost smug it's like he
knows it's bad and he's being smug to
the whole world i'm gonna get paid 12
million dollars for this
it's a me
a mario it's a
a mario it's a meat
a mario it's a meat
a mario
it's a meat

Is Squid Game The Most Watched Show in History? - YouTube
welcome to marketing monday today's
topic will be about mainly i want to do
wins and fails today wins and fails the
main thing and i'm going to start right
off the bat with a [ __ ]
win a win that i'd rather not give and
that is to the the chuckle over at
netflix i'm sick of
netflix forcing me to watch whatever
their flavor of the month show is every
few months by getting everyone in the
world to talk about it simultaneously
okay i told myself no i'm just not gonna
watch squid game i watched tire king i
didn't care for it why did i waste my
time on tire king after everyone's like
you gotta watch hurricane tire king
turkey and they did it for the witcher
they did it every time they have a new
show they make everybody talk about it
and then it goes away and no one cares
anymore but yeah i'll talk about it and
so i was like i'm not gonna fall to the
pressure and then i found out that squid
game is not like those other shows
stranger things queen's gambit bird box
every single one of those combined does
not add up to the popularity of squid
games and i'm going to show you this
graph it doesn't include all things
you've said but this is a measure of
google search volume for selected series
you can see the crown a very popular
show mandalorian disney plus biggest
show is this big the witcher huge tiger
king which is everywhere is here squid
game max off the charts domination and
and it's global squid game is truly
global this popular every country all
over the world it's the biggest hit
possibly outside of stranger things that
netflix has ever had and so they're
rapidly trying to i'm sure make
spin-offs and sequels and merch and
ride in a movie and um get the actors
and actresses and others they're going
to do a million things on this and so at
this point i feel like i'm not doing my
due diligence as a marketer if i don't
watch it even though i already know the
story because i played the roblox squid
games so i'm gonna watch it now i have
to it's been my duty they finally got me
among us was bigger than squid game okay
we're
talking bro we're talking about tv
series
are you like an among us fan like i'm
not [ __ ] out among us here yeah
melissa's really big as well thank you
scrubs and psych are goaded shows what
what do you think we're talking about do
you think we're just listing
shows that were good
what are you talking about that's my
first win that's my first win and we're
gonna we're gonna actually segue that
right into my second win um it's the
same win
it's the same win it's netflix this
chart just came out this one follows up
my second theme on original content
netflix has the bulk of it prime video
number two with invincible and the boys
number three disney plus apple tv hulu
hbo max paramount plus and other which
is a hodgepodge netflix is the one
streamer out of all of these that has
relatively low churn which is where some
people in general consider netflix to be
a bill something you have to pay
it's not a choice people consider other
streamers to be something you buy
watch the show you want and then cancel
but with netflix people consider netflix
to be like just like electricity water
netflix you just have to have it either
you have somebody's password or you buy
it it is like a thing that is a
requirement to doing business
and that mental switch has been huge for
netflix because they just don't lose
customers they they they mostly just
continue to grow people don't really
churn out like you don't buy netflix
watch queen's gambit and then say okay
i'm done but you do do that for prime
video for disney plus for apple tv for
who you know that's that's more common
of a behavior people are much more um
thoughtful about their bills and are
willing to cut at a moment's notice but
not for netflix just like conor subs
[Laughter]
okay so connor said that
people can say
people consider connor subs like bills
something you just have to pay
that's mango if there's anybody who's
like that on twitch it's mango even if i
i could go too much without watching
mango and i would never consider cutting
it's like alright i like melee i watch
melee even if i never tune in or only
watch a little bit it doesn't matter
it's it's my bill i pay that bill
because i'm a melee fan it's like union
dues yeah it's like ride or die let's
keep this game going let's make sure
mele uh mango never quits
all right i gave out two wins let's give
out some fails oh yeah
okay i'm gonna i'm gonna get some [ __ ]
for this um well not for the first part
the fail goes to blizzard that's not
gonna give me some that part's fine but
i'm also not a fan of crypto
and i know a lot of you especially
zoomers just think krypto is the future
and you're all gonna make money off it
and if you've made any money off it
you're even more insufferable if you've
managed to flip one
jpeg nft and make some money you're like
it's the future it's amazing it's
changing everything it's crazy kryptos
you don't get it and i'm glad i'm super
glad you guys all and you've created
real value one thing i i can tell you
when you've flipped your jpeg to some
other idiot in a neverending game of hot
potato that's eventually gonna end it's
like somebody who made a bunch of money
on mommy blogger pyramid schemes and
you're like yeah i've made money selling
leggings to other moms i think crypto is
literally mlms for
boys
and so my fail goes to blizzard because
i found out that all of this [ __ ] crypto
and nfts and everything comes because
blizzard nerfed a character
in wow they nerfed the
warlocks siphon life spell this is a
true [ __ ] story i happily played
world of warcraft during 2007-2010 but
one day blizzard removed the damage
component of my beloved warlock siphon
life spell i cried myself to sleep and
on that day i realized what horrors
centralized services can bring i soon
decided to quit that's the origin story
for ethereum a person who cried
themselves to sleep because their
warlock siphon life spell wasn't as
strong that's so [ __ ] crazy
uh
my next fail speaking of squid game i
like to shout out bad marketing every
now and then what is this nutter butter
squid game this squid game that we want
nut game
nut game really you thought this is a
good [ __ ] idea nut game i can't even
scroll these replies nut game really a
third fail no actually let's do a win
let's do it i actually never might wait
i'll double down
speaking of bad tweets this one came out
of nintendo france
they deleted it
insta
bro you're definitely fired well i got
four thousand retweets instead then they
got deleted um that's not up nintendo's
alley i remember when i was going to
host well before i streamed i was
through luck and pluck asked to host the
pokemon 20th anniversary stream because
someone else had dropped out and i
hosted uh the twitch weekly show at the
time so they were celebrating 20 years
of pokemon and i was a host they asked
me the night before the stream because
they needed someone quickly and and i
worked at twitch and i was available
it's so i got this by the way and so i
got this guy i stole this from the set
this guy was on the set and i literally
yinked him this is a true story i have
them ever since but what i remember is
that um the the the basically the night
before it's like this is like almost
like 2 a.m actually or or maybe it's
probably 1am 1am the day of the shoot i
get pulled into this boardroom it's
cause i was at the office late and
that's one of the reasons i got picked i
was in the office late the night before
and they were like frantically setting
up the set and trying to get someone
ready for rehearsals or whatever and i
was there they're like yeah let's do it
so i get pulled in and it was four
nintendo employees at the at the desk by
the way this is our office they had
commandeered a board room in twitch's
office and they were sitting there like
they owned the place i'm walking in i
work here and they were like sitting
around it like
like the bosses and they were like okay
please sit down and then they they
pulled up they took a laptop and they
pulled up my social media and they went
like tweet by tweet looking for anything
wrong in my history they went through my
entire like media history in front of me
to see if there was anything that would
disqualify me and they were like oh you
said hell here or something like they
were like pointing out anytime i had
cursed like you said ass in 2007 on
twitter i was like yeah yeah i did
i don't know it was funny because like
they were acting real like um you know
tough like well this might just qualify
you but in my mind i'm sort of like bro
this shoot is in like six hours it's 1am
who else are you gonna get the office is
empty i'm the only one here because i'm
a degenerate who are you gonna get what
kind of leverage do you really have i'm
your best shot but i was like yeah i
mean i did say yes i didn't i didn't
[ __ ] i didn't like hardball but i wasn't
like scared because at the end of the
day i was like i don't even know if i
want to do this i it was my weekend it
was on a weekend i was like i kind of
want to go home or play some more melee
i was like yeah i did
everything i was like yep i said that
that's me and eventually they're like
okay well you're going to want to be
careful
[Laughter]
fine
and uh and then they let me do it
and i had fun and that's how i met
jaywitz who ended up being one of my
good friends and my co-worker if i ever
work with nintendo i'll just purge my
twitter because they won't know how to
use wayback machine oh yeah for sure but
you would have to purge your twitter
connor because you've said nintendo like
every three days for the past year
that's why they they probably fired the
guy from nintendo france what i'm trying
to say uh all right that's not my winner
or fail though let's go to the next one
i want to show you
that's my favorite this is not i was
going to call this a fail bro this is a
win this is a win this is a massive win
it is genius it is of course the new
esports line of clothing at walmart
look at this let's get a full zoom baby
esport e
league of nothing
just league of
sx 360
esx360
esports pro wear random kanji i don't
know what they say
so again i was gonna originally make fun
of this and call it a fail and then i
was like is that just classist of me
like if i was a gamer kid who shopped at
walmart i would get it and then i
scrolled up and saw their 60 bucks
they're 53 to 60 dollars what the [ __ ]
are you talking about that's not for
[ __ ] kids they can't like buy a
hundred thieves hoodie or something like
you can get a team liquid hoodie for
cheaper than this this is [ __ ] way
too expensive so now i'm back to making
fun of it again but then i thought about
it again on a third level and i was like
wait these are kind of ironically dope
it's like yeah you could have a team
liquid hoodie or you could have the esx
360 walmart hoodie
which is actually kind of gangster and
so now i'm back on board as a dub when i
got a tweet from slime what did slime
tweet
[Laughter]
wait he got it
oh my fashion icon slime dude that's
actually so sick okay not all of them
were marketing related i just thought i
would include this one this is a win no
no commentary necessary let's all watch
this and if you think it's a win spam w
and i think it's a lost spam l okay i
think it's a win but your call
that's it
this is the final one i have a bombshell
for you everyone's been tagging me in
this coke ad they've been telling me to
watch this coke ad i thought it would be
funny if i live react to it on stream so
despite the fact that it's been many
many days now i actually i swear hand to
god i have not watched this ad it's
called real magic it's about a minute
long and it's been called by some to be
one of the worst ads of all time the
real contest will be is it worse than
the iconic kendall jenner pepsi ad that
is the real question who has made the
worst soda add of the past 10 years i've
only seen the first five seconds
[Applause]
sports arena they're playing
oh my god i want to put i'm going to go
through this as i see it i'm going to be
pausing peter here real quick they are
playing
i don't know what this is a futuristic
orc fighter they're playing lord of the
rings the for the gamecube single player
game what what the [ __ ] are they playing
rachel legends
they're playing raid
shadow legends world championship this
orc gets the drop on this gamer
no i'm sorry the knight knocks him back
and he [ __ ] slumps this year his
name's shadow by the way
cool
i'm sorry no shadow's his sponsor his
tag is g warrior
so he reaches over and this [ __ ]
fully realized unreal engine 5 ray
tracing on graphics of the orc crying
during a multiplayer match
and he cracks the cocoa cola
oh yeah
and then the coca-cola which is
85 sugar enters his dna
and somehow buffs his character
they're just putting down the weapons
okay
sorry to pause again
in the middle of a tournament where no
one was getting hurt right because it's
a gaming tournament
it's like equivalent to lebron james
throwing down the basketball and like
shaking his opponent's hand they can
still be friends and compete there's not
no one's getting hurt it's not a real
war and then this commentator who
is dressed like he's about to rob a
convenience store says and then they
throw in their weapons average jonas
famous streamer says are you seeing this
this is
let's read what the chat says they say
lag did you see what i see or is my pc
dead for real screen screen screen
screen omg i smell a secret smash move
gambit style a truck viewer i'm glad one
of you was watching average jonas in
your spare time hello from paris did i
miss anything also an hrough viewer
[Music]
this is not a powerful moment
everybody in like some subculture around
the world is all watching the rage shot
legends tournament on their phone
and is like clapping and crying because
the
match was stopped
we are one coke away from each other
that's
that's a [ __ ] tagline and a half
[Music]
he salutes his own character so the
character is no longer represented by
him his character has now become alive
through the coke and his dna
he salutes his own digital character who
is now sentient who nods back so pepsi
may have uh solved riots in the real
world but coke did one better coke saw
violence in video games and for that in
my mind
they win uh anyway my final verdict this
ad was terrible
but i liked it more than the
pepsi one because they mentioned gamers
and i'm a gamer so i feel heard and i
feel seen i will be purchasing a large
volume of coca-cola
[Music]
you
Harambe vs. Wall Street - YouTube
all right
hey get pause all right let me talk to
you it is now time for marketing monday
wins and fails starting with a win for
the entire
internet for people that respect our our
our history our lineage and our fallen
soldiers but because today
a giant statue of harambe the gorilla
was put up right across from the wall
street ball
to the race for now and they surrounded
the oh my god shut up they surrounded
the ball with 10 000 bananas
and put harambe staring it down
almost daring capitalism to stop him and
i would like to give a a salute to
whatever heroes put this gigantic bronze
statue up
uh they also said they would donate all
10 000 bananas to local food shelters
anyway it's what harambe would have
wanted
that's the first win of the day let me
give you a fail though we gotta
counterbalance all wins with fails the
fail though is for hey can i get a show
of hands this is honest question are any
of you in graphic des based on
if you guys don't know i uh just spent a
few minutes before this segment for the
youtube viewers a few minutes before
this segment uh working on my thumbnail
are any of you graphic designers
well all of you are saying yes because
of
your help earlier with my thumbnail but
the ones that actually are well guess
what here's the fail everyone that's not
doesn't have an opportunity to get
involved in this sick internship i found
to get this internship that my friend
zell put me on to
look at this currently this internship
is for resume value and hands-on work
experience
for every project you're involved in
35 will be available through a lottery
how dope is that
graphic design kings and queens out
there get on this
you could work on dozens of projects and
eventually
maybe win 35
it is my dream one day for all jobs be
paid in gotcha mechanics i would love if
like every time i did a full day's work
i got like a token
that i could use to spin for a five-star
paycheck
you know maybe maybe i don't get it the
first time or the first hundred times
but eventually i might actually get a
full day's wage
um thank you zel for
pointing this out i think he's saying
excuse me what the [ __ ] because he's so
excited he's like what the [ __ ] how is
this how is this opportunity so good
and again everyone pressure your
congress people pressure your local
business people let's try and get gotcha
game mechanics into all of our
workplaces for a better and happier life
that's our first fail
let's get
a
oh yeah
let's get another win uh actual win not
a joke win 100 thieves i'm giving him an
actual win this week not because of
their performance in league of legends
they did not get out of uh groups
but because they actually did a really
good business idea and purchased
keyboard company
high ground let me explain why this is a
huge deal um stanz and i talked about
this back on esports from the connect a
few years ago when there was the rise of
that do you guys remember that fortnite
based mouse company
final mouse uh
actually made a dent in some of uh the
big mouse company's market share
by being a little bit more nimble around
uh using gamers
and esports athletes
uh in partnership with the mice to sell
them that is a very smart way to sell
physical products and 100 thieves
essentially a marketing company
disguised as an esports company 100
thieves
main goal is not winning esports
tournaments acquiring them allows them
to sell luxury keyboards at a huge
markup with great marketing using teams
it's a really brilliant business idea if
this gets popular it could be quite a
lot of money i did a win let's do a fail
so the fail is this guy
uh this is a good sign for where i think
the current stock market is at
with so much fraud and so much
speculation
this guy went on and tried to pump a
stock okay
but there's a
a little secret that comes out halfway
through so let's watch it
that is one uh tesla mgm and aig why
those four all of which you've bought
within well basically this week except
tesla uh end of last month
yeah so well up starts up about 25
percent just in four days since we since
we bought so right now he's he bought
the stock upstart holdings and now he's
talking about how great it is on tv
so other people will buy it okay very
powerful very strong earnings sounds
good
what do they do
uh excuse me what does upstart do
uh well
i'm i'm
i'm sorry what kind of company is it
yeah i'm not you're you're breaking up
oh
well i guess we've got an audio problem
there mark i'm sorry
what a terrible [ __ ] way to get out
of it
he's like moving fluidly i'm sorry
you're breaking up it's not he doesn't
even like try to
i'm going through a tunnel i'm not he
should have like taken a crumpled paper
it's so obviously fraudulent the guy has
no [ __ ] idea what the company's
chilling for even does great company
strong fundamentals great management
what are you [ __ ] talking about what
do they do so anyway i feel like this is
the truth for a lot of companies or a
lot of people are in the digital space
right now
who will talk up something with no
[ __ ] idea what they're talking about
yeah we actually donate 0.0001
of every
50th coin
to a charity in the cayman islands
connected back to our bank account so
this is actually
altruistic what we're doing this is
gonna change the world this altcoin
anyway okay uh so that guy's the fail
let me get you a okay let's give some
sevens to nintendo here uh they've lost
their streak the win is now sony
who snapped the streak 33 straight
months of best-selling console nintendo
switch but what goes up must come down
ps5 has finally beaten in both units and
dollars the demand for ps5s is through
the roof
they're actually producing quite a few
they're just all getting sold they're
getting sold instantly uh so the win is
sony
who is uh
again doing extremely well with the ps5
if you recall in my video back in
january i predicted that ps5 would edge
out this console war uh between them
xbox and nintendo and i'm sticking to it
i think they've uh withstood some of the
more uh expensive acquisitions of
microsoft enough so ps5 is doing pretty
well it's not artificial scarcity no i
don't believe that speaking of that
actually on the same not even just a
similar win
so previously we talked about uh how one
of the biggest obstacles to sony's
success is the fact that microsoft has
way way way way way more money than them
when they bought bethesda for 7.5
billion in response to that there was a
uh bit of a leak that came out today
that sony has set aside
and and absolutely staggering for them
13 to 18 billion dollars to spend on
acquisitions for playstation that means
sony is ready to buy game companies
they're gonna buy things as big as
bethesda buying game companies to to to
bolster their first party lineup of
playstation games and that's huge
that means this war is getting
absolutely crazy and a console war means
that as long as they stay competitive
it's really good for us because they'll
be cheaper
cheaper hardware uh games will get
expensive we'll get more uh better
online deals all that shit's gonna
happen as long as they're as long as
we're competing unless one side wins
then we're [ __ ] no that's twice
nintendo nintendo does their own thing
the only thing that has to worry about
is that they are eventually ending the
cycle of the switch and they don't have
a good follow-up announced already and
usually nintendo follows up a good
console with a bad one and so
everyone's waiting for the other shoe to
drop nintendo to really [ __ ] up a good
thing i'm gonna give one actual win and
the one i'm i'm most invested in
um in this past week 10 000 john deere
workers went on strike um along with a
lot of other labor action across the
country there was a number of strikes in
in different industries and i want to
give a personal shout out to these john
deere workers who sort of led the charge
they were being extremely exploited uh
they've had they've had literally
minimal to no wage growth in in over a
decade uh i want to say that i'm
just in general as a person i'm deeply
pro-labor even the capitalist side of my
brain is deeply pro-labor i think they
should just be more organized so they
have more effective ways to leverage
their power because they have power and
they should have an effective way to
leverage it it shouldn't be like
cheating the system to like disorganize
and divide them so you can exploit them
more they should just have the power
they they have earned and be able to
argue for things that they're creating
so
yeah feel great about this this is a
huge win
and uh what's funny is um so immediately
after this strike
john deere responded by getting
they couldn't get strike breakers right
because the work requires training so
they got all their their white-collar
workers all like the office managers
they got all of them
to work the factory they got like a
crash course in training and they're
working the factory like 14-hour days
and they're not going to last yeah they
they immediately had a tractor crash the
non-union salaried workers a lot of them
were immediately quitting because they
found out how miserable the conditions
were
it was it was a loss all around so john
deere hopefully
will have to actually negotiate with
this union and increase their wages but
humanity
as a whole
is my fail for this week
because they found a way
to put guns on robot dogs
pretty much the last thing we had over
robot dogs that we could hold a gun
so
and based on my experience with metroid
i don't think we're gonna be able to hit
the two frame parries
say it has
30x optical zoom thermal camera for
targeting the dark effective range of
1200 meters
it can kill at night or in the day they
can go without sleeping without stopping
and there is no ban on killer robots
so we're we're in a interesting time
so outside of that nothing to worry
about besides
100 thieves bought high ground so we're
going to have cool keyboards
you
WHY ZUCKERBERG WHY - YouTube
welcome welcome welcome welcome to
marketing monday today let's get right
into the wins and fails we have too much
to waste time the biggest wins and fails
this week came from one company formerly
known as facebook
first i'm gonna add one right now i just
thought of me the first win is me
because i called it live on stream i
posted on twitter and most importantly i
got thousands of likes the good thing
about getting that prediction right
was that i've never
ever
gotten a prediction wrong
and that is what makes me
a genius
humanity gets the first win you know why
because this man mark zuckerberg is now
in charge of how we connect with each
other
deb do you want to take us through some
of the exciting games in the pipeline
for quest absolutely
over the years we've had the opportunity
to work within by the way
i don't want to just roast mark
zuckerberg here
i also want to roast deb a little bit
these people have the least human
conversation i have ever seen this is
what we get incredible developers like
vertigo games the studio behind fan
favorite arizona sunshine i love arizona
sunshine that game basically got me and
my friends through the first few months
of the pandemic that's awesome if you
enjoyed that mark i think you'll be
excited that we're partnering with
vertigo on five more great games from
deep silver and others we'll share more
about this lineup very soon it's like
he's giving off so little emotion
android that she's overdoing it to
compensate
they assume if if one of them is
dramatically over gesturing and one is
not moving at all and not blinking that
they're one normal person
beat saver has a passionate community i
love beat saber so do i
hey me too mark he's he is robotically
still he his hand hasn't left the top of
that [ __ ] table in the exact same
spot and she is [ __ ] flailing
[Music]
i can't wait to play this that was your
big reveal trailer
[Laughter]
mark mark mark wait
mark mark you simply
you simply have to check this
out
and then it's a one second logo
okay have you played population one i
mean yeah i love the game so much for
those who haven't population
first of all
did she just like
cut off her boss did she ask him a
question and then cut him off in his own
announcement for the meta
for some reason getting cut off is what
really gets him i mean yeah i love the
game so much
[Laughter]
it's like someone's in his ear like hey
you need to smile more hey this is to
make you seem relatable smile more
that was my first win for humanity
because we have that guy
and his company in charge of our social
interaction big win for humans
thank god we got the right man for the
job
let's get to my next win i have two wins
in a row because i'm a positive person
so if you guys know
the big five tech companies for the
first probably like the 2014 era silicon
valley explosion
were facebook amazon apple netflix and
google and they were called fang but
with the change
of facebook to meta they're now calling
it
manga but this isn't really right
right
it's not really right well first of all
big reason netflix
no longer a top dog but luckily we can
change netflix to nvidia
then we'll keep the end
nvidia is now a top 10 company worldwide
and worth double what netflix is apple
stays the same but google if we're going
to count facebook as meta then google is
now alphabet
so
what does that leave us with extreme
fang is now mana officially i am the
first to call it i didn't see anyone on
twitter say this they had a bunch of
different funny ones but i'm saying it's
mana because it's meta apple
nvidia
alphabet amazon
mana
and it's gonna work perfectly when the
rock becomes our president it's all
connected and this is all proof of the
illuminati and the robot lizard people
that zuckerberg is trying to uh dominate
us for let's see what's a fail though to
counter it out the fail is
chipotle and roblox
so if you guys don't know chipotle
opened a store
where you could get
free burrito codes in chipotle in roblox
and immediately roblox went down but i
will say it is now back as of yesterday
afternoon
check it out
we're in the chipotle burrito maze
now this is marketing
great all right i am a bag of chips
who that lead the way
okay
oh this is avocado i got it
i got five seconds of super jump wait
[ __ ]
[ __ ]
i wasted it
isn't this every kid's dream to dress up
as a
piece of branded property
anyway that's a fail that was a fail
i'm gonna give i reviewed it i give it a
fail
this one is for every single person out
there who falls into a category of
gamers that i like to call
the best kind
aka
pc gamers
if you are a pc gamer you are having a
good week
because of the announcement of the brand
new
playstation pc brand an official brand
dedicated to porting all playstation
exclusives and classics to pc
so if you are a pc gamer this is a win
and this is a product of pretty unique
market dynamics i mean this is a this is
an insane competition between sony and
microsoft
if you remember
last week on marketing monday i
announced that sony had
a record quarter
sales way up though profit was declining
because they're spending all the money
they make on this war everything sony
and microsoft is making in their
respective xbox and ps5 divisions is up
on revenue they're making more money
than ever but they're spending more
money than ever the war is expensive and
so in an effort to offset some of those
costs they are looking for ways to make
money
without giving up any ground to the
competitor
welcome to pc gaming baby this is an
important one hey shut the [ __ ] up hey
everyone chill out this is an important
win
okay it doesn't happen very often
every
once in a while in human history there
will be a breakthrough
so powerful and so dynamic that we think
about life before and after you know
what i'm saying well this week it was
the solving
of world
hunger world hunger is no longer a
problem after a man who goes by the name
dylan figured out that you could get a
six flags magic mountain annual pass for
150
and just eat all your meals there every
day lunch and dinner
every day for years he paid off all his
student loans got married and bought a
house in la
off of 150 bucks a year and if you think
about it that could work for everyone
and if you're hungry right now
go to six flags okay another this one
was hard to categorize as a witness or a
win or a fail this is actually i think i
broke my brain on this one
this is the only one i could not find a
hero
in a story of two villains okay so you
guys know how i've been uh
kind of a crusader against nft scams
and i've also been critical of nintendo
for being way way way too lawsuit happy
with fan-made projects
the rubber met the road the rock met the
hard place
nintendo's lawyers strike again
this time against a mario nft gambling
game
that's tough
who do i root for so yeah i don't know
you guys decide that's a winner or fail
in your books but i just know that it's
something's evil about it
this might be the most evil
like in one headline
since like world war ii
you got nintendo's lawyers and a mario
nfc gambling game
anyway you know what actually i'm
cheering for the game because you know
why their lawyers are striking it
probably so nintendo can make it
i do have a fail
for a couple crypto scams this week
anyone who invested in squid coin the
squid game based crypto token which had
a parabolic rise
earlier today uh in the morning it was
worth 38 dollars a coin
an hour later is worth ninety dollars a
coin by three am 93 by four
435 dollars a squid coin 10 extra
investment in three hours by five it was
worth nearly three thousand dollars a
coin by 540 it was worthless you have
the clip of it crashing live please send
please send
seeing crypto scams
punish crypto bros live is like my
favorite thing
just the total
amount of coins that are locked staked
whatever the [ __ ] going on that would
be the uh the fully uh
but obviously the real one is not
so the market cap is 2.168
trillion
dollars
and now the market
so i looked into it it was set up to
where only the founder and creator of
squid coin was able to sell it was
literally locked out of selling for
everyone else you could only buy
so everyone bought squid coin he sold it
all at once when it hit two thousand
dollars
made
insane money
everyone else lost money not a single
other person made money
is this a crime
definitely but you can't really
trace very easily these crypto rug pulls
so i don't think
they'll get caught
you
The Creepiest Commercials of All Time - YouTube
um all right so welcome to marketing
monday today's topic is the scariest
spookiest ads of all time we've gone
through and found some of the absolutely
craziest shock value type commercials
that have ever been aired be sure to
find a study buddy to keep you safe and
protected let's walk through some of
these but first before i do let me give
you a little bit of explanation as to
why a company might want to run a scary
ad they had a bunch of people watch ads
and they did mris to study which parts
of their brain lit up during certain
times of ads and they found no i'm no
brain expert but something in the
amygdala uh was grabbing deeper
attention and settling deeper memories
roots in your brains uh when two of
either things happened one when there
was shock value something that violated
a social norm something that sort of got
you out of your comfort zone or one that
made you feel scared those two things
activated the same thing but it turns
out you could activate the fear one
without breaking social norms while the
other one the shock value one often can
get your brand in trouble as in this
example this is one of the examples they
gave this is the fashion junkie ad this
shock value ad was memorable where two
coked out models are snorting a dress
but it was not effective for the brand a
little pushback so if you're looking to
get that deep psychological response but
you don't want the risk of something
like this you go for a more spooky ad
something that makes you afraid these
are my these are the prime ones my
favorite scary ads of all time and by
the way favorite is a strong word
they're they are not
good in my mind but they're the ones
that stuck out to me because they they
played on a lot of channels i watched
when i was a kid are the ps3 series of
ads like this one
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
uh one of the weirdest ads i ever saw as
a kid and this is why i want to talk
about it because i think that original
study i talked about was flawed yes this
ad is memorable i have not forgotten
this ad sometimes i lie awake at night
and i think about this ad but this is
not a great way to market a product
because it has nothing to do with the
product at the end of the day you
remembering that creepy baby does not
imply
that you are more or like less likely to
buy a playstation so it was kind of
useless and they really doubled down on
these ads for a while they said famously
yeah peter dill the vp of marketing
peter dill weed more like it
peter dill the vp of marketing for sony
highest marketing title
at sony said uh the ad is the ultimate
rorschach inkblot test the ad doesn't
have any specific meaning and it's open
to interpretation it incites emotions
like he's some kind of artiste you're
selling consoles
to gamers i don't know what coke you're
on but he said that eventually until he
was overruled or fired i don't have his
employment history and they switched to
these ads dear playstation i got a tip
that you were making the ps3 299
our deny
299 bernie you can't believe everything
you read on the internet that's how
world war one got started while 299 for
the sweetest gaming blu-ray-playing
movie downloading system in the world
would be fantastic
no comment
ps3 it only does everything now 299.
they talk about the play they tell the
price about what it does about blu-ray
about games and guess what even though
kevin butler is probably not the best
pitch person these ads did phenomenally
it turns out that the weird the months
and months and months of weird creepy
off-putting ads that explain nothing
with a huge price tag were not
successful this is burger king's hashtag
scary clown night what a popular hashtag
hashtag scaryclown night
ad let's see how it goes
[Music]
i want my whopper
um what i hated most about this burger
king ad that when he gets to the burger
king it's not a safe space the whole
crux of this ad he's scared he gets the
burger king it should be bright and well
lit and delicious and have good food
inside and he laughs at the clown while
he's inside instead he gets the burger
king and it's full of clowns that just
makes you seem like the [ __ ] weird
company full of clowns the whole the
whole message becomes that like you have
a weird scary dark restaurant full of
clowns on halloween if you want a safe
well that place go to mcdonald's
i hated it i thought the ending was so
bad you could you had a perfect
opportunity to like make bird kings seem
dope but i like doing the ideas you come
to register the clown you get a whopper
sandwich but end of the day that gets
everyone dressing up as a clown which is
ronald mcdonald's thing it feels kind of
stupid i just hate most marketing that's
like
too targeted at your competitor i think
any marketing where it's like giving
your competitor a ton of attention so
you get a crumb
you're spending your money to give them
more attention scary ad bad one let's do
skittles scary ad called floor 9.5 when
i think of scary brands there is none
scarier than skittles so let's see what
the masters of horror over at skittles
came up with skittles presents bite size
horror
join us
i need your help i need your help
what
all right
can you quit
okay
please
you gotta turn around
[Music]
i'm sorry
oh
wait is she locked on the floor
hello
hey
i need your help
starburst
skittles
[Laughter]
i could use the skittles although i'll
be honest with you so what i'm seeing
for the strategy on that one is the
concept is
being an advertisement at all we're
gonna give some director the chance to
make a bite-sized horror film that will
get shared a lot on the internet because
it's interesting we're going to only
attach our brand to the very beginning
and we're just going to get a little bit
of a large pie rather than try to force
horror into a candy commercial so it is
a cool idea it probably got some buzz
that kind of thing probably only works
once or twice the idea is that these
bite-sized horror flicks could go viral
get shared a lot the best way to make
content on the internet right now is by
optimizing for word of mouth if you are
creating a short form piece of content
for the internet try to imagine how it
gets shared in a group chat if you have
not designed it to be shared in a group
chat then you have that designed for the
modern internet that's the way things
spread nowadays the best piece of advice
i got was literally design content for a
group chat it is it is though it is way
more likely to go viral if you if it's
shared one to many in small groups than
trying to go big on a platform let's
watch the other ones see if they're any
better
presents
hey not too far dinner is soon
[Music]
that would be scary as [ __ ]
[Music]
but this is like the scariest thing to a
kid in the world
this is like the scariest thing you can
imagine
[Music]
let me in
did jordan peel steal his whole [ __ ]
from a starburst commercial
um connor had a great question where he
said um isn't the primary demographic
for candy kids
and don't they not want to be scared yes
that's technically true but i think this
is probably more people who'll be
purchasing the candy again the kids
don't buy the candy around halloween the
kids get the candy and i think bite size
horse is a creative internet-based
concept the problem is most of the time
when i hear someone say this one's
actually a pretty good commercial it's a
commercial that has nothing to do with
the product
it's like yeah that's called a movie
it's like if i watched um
knives out i'm like that was a pretty
good commercial because it didn't have
to boil with products though you know i
mean you know what i'm saying if you
just make a good short that has no
product in it the hard part of
commercials is including the marketing
message that's the hard part so the
either the options are you do it poorly
which is most commercials or you don't
do it all which is other crystals the
very good commercials manage to do the
marketing message and be interesting
it's that's the very hard thing that is
the [ __ ] the holy grail of marketing
because either in the first option they
get bored they don't care the second
option they love it and don't remember
your product you have to get both but i
think the way these work is still pretty
clever this is an actual japanese ad and
it has a warning at the beginning oh i
lost my [ __ ] camera again bro what if
i plan this whole thing
and then the camera goes out right at
the end and you hear a [ __ ] knife
sound
and i scream
anyway let's watch this ad this is not
for the faint of heart all right play
okay
[Music]
i didn't watch that i didn't watch it
ahead of time i was wondering what could
it possibly be to have this
bro it's an entire commercial in japan
and it's just a internet jump scare from
my 2004. while we're on it i don't know
how effective that was because it really
didn't show i mean i guess i don't know
what this what this says maybe japanese
yeah i guess they get out of the snow
on their top-notch tires pretty quickly
there's something there
he's able to reverse on the snow really
quickly but
outside of that i can't really tell
let's see this one this one's fragile
childhood monsters
[Music]
[Music]
i had a truly
okay i had one truly it was a mango
truly i'm sorry i'm not
holy [ __ ] dude it was a white claw on a
saturday good ad for a good cause it's
always bro i need to do a whole certain
marketing monday on like um psas these
public awareness ads always feel like
they can go to extreme shock value
because they have no corporation
answered for so they always go
absolutely over the top with making you
feel something uh psas are crazy uh this
one was pretty scary i don't think a kid
sees you like this rabbit if you have a
white claw
hey that's my dad don't mind him
i'm sorry mango one more check it out
dark devil the exorcist
damn well shot
i already can tell the cinematic values
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
whoa
big twist good oh my god good ad actual
[ __ ] in the actual comedy in the actual
product also their name dirt devil fits
in fun memorable good ad
that actually wins best scary ad of all
time actually makes you think of the
product anyway uh so that so it shows it
can be done so my overall conclusion
here is that while scary ads are often
ineffective uh fear is a powerful
emotion to trigger interest attention
and uh memory so if you are able to
harness that for your marketing in a way
that doesn't make the audience feel
cheated or angry or annoyed or jump
scared then you may be able to find a
win and turn it back to something
positive

How Riot Beat Blizzard. - YouTube
riot games
and blizzard entertainment
a tale
of two companies
blizzard a storied one going back to all
the way to the 90s
many legendary games starcraft warcraft
world of warcraft overwatch riot games
relatively recent
uh 10 years of league of legends into a
whole slew of new games in this past
week blizzard entertainment has had
probably the worst week in the history
of its company and riot games
has had possibly the best in this past
week this would happen for blizzard okay
number one diablo 4 and overwatch 2 were
delayed to 2023 at the earliest largely
due to a number of leaders of blizzard
leaving all at once
uh and again these were the two games at
the last blizzcon that they were sort of
counting on to save the company at a
time when they needed good news the most
they were given bad blizzard's president
co-president i'm sorry co-lead jen
o'neil quit her job three months into
the role after realizing she was only
hired
as a gesture of tokenism to have a woman
in leadership and she realized she
couldn't make any impact she openly said
that and she quit three months in then
they cancelled blizzcon the effort
required to put on blizzcon is better
supporting our teams meaning we don't
have enough people
we can't put this on it's gonna and also
everyone's gonna be angry at us and so
we're gonna get yelled at by the fans
the entire time we're just not gonna do
it we're just not gonna do it also even
more importantly they have nothing to
announce
this is the key thing
i guarantee you if diablo 4 was good and
ready to launch they would put on
blizzcon because they need to win worst
of all
the most damning thing you could have
happened to your company is is jesus
himself said this i think at this point
it's safe to say activision blizzard is
the most evil video game company ever
this is a picture of the ceo of ea
trying to smile
[Laughter]
because somebody finally knocked them
off the list
blizzard has done it they've taken what
we i was like an unbeatable record dude
but that's blizzard's week let's talk
about riot games week okay riot games
breaks records with arcane as netflix's
best rated show ever and now i don't
think that'll last there's a lot of hype
around the beginning there's a lot of
fans but it's still phenomenally
reviewed the critic scores a hundred
percent and the audience scores 99
uh on a fan related movie on a fan
related movie it's always like critic
score 22
audience score 93 and it's the first
show
since the launch of squid game to
dethrone it and that's just one thing
they also surprise dropped two new games
out of nowhere blizzard can't find a
game in the couch cushions and riot
games just dropped two games out of
nowhere they're tossing them off hand at
this point and they announced two more
games um and they also released
information on project l
uh which looks amazing and i was
thinking uh wow this week really
summarizes what the past few years have
felt like where it's all slipping more
towards riot and away from blizzard and
i found this quora thread from 2017
where somebody asked the question who's
better rider blizzard it's from 2017 and
the responses were unanimous for
blizzard this guy worked it both and he
said for me blizzard is leagues ha ha
above and beyond riot in terms of
creative diversity and maturity of
intellectual properties back in 2017
generally most people would agree riot
games was why even have the s they're
one game and blizzard is the king of the
block and so there's there's a lot of
reasons that they have been diverged
okay but the main theme i want to have
is uh
innovation versus exploitation one of
these companies
was sued by the state of california
for a culture of sexual harassment one
of these companies was also deeply tied
to china
and and warned all of its casters to
speak nothing about the hong kong
situation the other companies blizzard
who did the same things but worse
it's both and yet for some reason riot
is on top of the world today let's start
by talking about arcane again okay
fantastic [ __ ] show my god i have no
deep affinity for the league of legends
lore outside of me fizz
it's a well-written show the animation's
good i'm just i'm just super impressed
and i'm not the only one so this is what
i was talking about a hundred percent on
the tomato 98 audience score
this is in my mind far and away the best
video game film or tv adaptation ever
having seen i think all of them
oh yeah i'm sorry you know what outside
of the new mario movie with chris pratt
so the show was so good
that my friend jimmy wong
had to tweet a psa
as someone who has played league of
legends for eight years now please
don't play it just because you watched
arcane
and i'm here to echo that psa
arcade is a fantastic show i love it
it will not be drawing me back in to
play ranked league of legends that being
said i don't think these psalms have any
effect because i'll show you this graph
what do you guys think this graph is
this is a graph of chess.com signups
after the launch of queen's gambit
that's the red line and that's a game
that is kind of intimidating for new
players league of legends uh brightly
colored uh better user flow is only
going to experience this on crack after
arcane success there's just no way this
is the world of warcraft movie
you'll notice
not quite as beloved
and this came out first like blizzard
had the idea first of turning their game
into a big uh media property making the
ip live beyond video games and so what
do they do differently than blizzard in
the situation well first of all
they were approached by many many people
to make league of legends film and tv
properties
and they turned them all down to use the
people in-house the people they put in
charge of this or people that made the
cinematics
and that is an incredibly brave decision
they didn't want to let somebody who had
more movie experience but no league
experience make their uh property and it
definitely shows in arcane
i always think of hitman whoever
made the timothy olyphant hitman had
never
even seen the game bro the way he acts
and what he does is nothing like
the game and so you can just tell
there's a huge disconnect people that
made the movie people made the game
blizzard
partnered for their movie they partnered
for their movie with legendary pictures
to make a live-action warcraft movie
back in 2006 and after 10 years of
switching directors switching talent
swapping in and out trying to find the
right fit they farted out a bad movie
a poorly received movie 10 years later
to make some money
a blizzard cinematic was better than the
world of warcraft movie and maybe
blizzard a company that could have done
this that had years of excellent
cinematics could have given their team a
chance giving them extra money giving
them a chance to go off and make a movie
instead
went with this and ended up with a a bad
result secondly and this is a major one
how both companies have responded to the
rise of influencers in the past let's
say five to seven years influencers and
creators have drastically changed the
gaming environment and companies that
understand them versus those that don't
are seeing
massive shifts in outcomes because like
yeah working with riots
such a day and night difference i had a
riot event and then i had a blizzard
event back to back right and riot paid
me to go to an event they also paid for
like they gave me like 500 in uber
credits
and like to travel for the blizzard
event they're like [ __ ] you find your
way here i have to use riot's uber
budget that they gave me so i can travel
to a blizzard event yeah you know we're
giving you exposure you get advanced
access you know that's your reward kind
of deal now
my editors will tell you i'm all for
paying exposure
[Laughter]
but when you're a big game company it
starts to look bad year after year when
everybody else is realizing how
important influencers are and paying
them appropriately early in this video
he talks about how
riot games made a bounty board to play
league of legends on stream and they
didn't care if you were tyler1
or xqc if you played league before or
you didn't then blizzard did the same
thing for hearthstone
but when toast tried to do it they said
no only if you've never played
hearthstone will we pay you
if we've already got you playing
hearthstone you don't get [ __ ]
and that sort of cheap ass attitude that
like us us first kind of thing is so
backwards looking and it's an arrogant
outlook is what it is later in the video
he talks about how blizzard
tried to fly out scarra toast and a
bunch of people to test their new game
for eight hours of play test for no
money they couldn't stream it they
couldn't make a video
they wanted to just sit down and play
test it for eight hours a day and give
them feedback for free and they thought
they would just be honored to try a new
blizzard game and that is like a that is
like a 2002 way of thinking there's a
business reason for this it's not just
like being nice if toast has been given
a lot of money and been treated really
well he's gonna think twice when there's
a bug in the game and he wants to like
[ __ ] the developer he's gonna be a
little nicer he's gonna soften his blow
blizzard because they pissed everyone
off over and over and over and over when
you mess up they will flip on you uh we
don't have any plans at moment to do uh
pc
[Music]
do you guys not have phones yeah you
guys all have spotify
you can play your tablet too
and again
in a different environment
had this been the one slip up and the
community trusted blizzard this one
moment probably wouldn't miss a bigger
deal there it just ignites
all the resentment that's been building
up and people just pounce on it and
every influencer that a bone to pick
with blizzard watch this clip a hundred
times the next day and roasted them look
at this face by the way this is the face
of a man who's got a phone
both of these companies
had
lawsuits from the state of california
about sexist culture how do they handle
those situations differently so this
this article came out from kotaku in
2016 inside the culture of successful
riot games this is before anything was
revealed at blizzard the immediate
response i i think the best way to
explain this actually i want to explain
how riot handles this in kind of a crass
way this is back when dave chappelle was
uh
more of a forward thinker and less of a
reactionary
turf it's one of the jokes i think kind
of summarizes in a crass way riot games
is strategy and this is when kobe bryant
was accused of sexual misconduct kobe
kept it together thank god he he held
his game together because if he was
cracking under pressure and getting like
six points a game
the whole l.a would have been like that
there's guilty
he was playing like his freedom depended
on that [ __ ]
you see this [ __ ] game this
[ __ ] trying to beat that case on the
court
and the idea of beating the case on the
court most people in my experience don't
give much amount of weight to your words
they don't every time something like
this happens at a big company they'll do
the same [ __ ] uh apology it's like a
youtuber apology it's it's like nobody
believes or trusts a youtuber apology
blizzard came out and said uh we don't
support
this type of workplace culture we're
gonna move towards a zero tolerance
policy
against sexual harassment and there was
a great bit in charlie's video where
he's like wow
everyone clapped that you finally went
for a zero tolerance policy like that's
not [ __ ] normal and so what riot
games sort of did in both these
situations they basically litigated
those cases on the court and by that i
mean
they started bawling
when this article came out
they followed it up with kda
their biggest
expansion into music
of all time and all of a sudden people
were forgetting instead of trying to
apologize and apologize and apologize
and until people like for some reason
forgave them they just dropped something
cool and that's the equivalent of kobe
starting to shoot 38 points a game you
know if you are backed against the wall
your options are crumble or remind
people why they like your company to
begin with get back to basics when uh
the blitz chunk situation happened this
guy blizztron came on screen at a
blizzard event and said freedom for hong
kong the glorious revolution of our age
something like that uh the casters
literally hid from the camera and they
were all fired including the casters
which was absolutely ludicrous
extreme extreme over-the-top response
denied him his prize money
denied him um a place in the hall of
fame
banned him for life from blizzard events
it got extreme negative pushback
everyone rose up of course is a
censorship this is terrible by the way
this is an american company blizzard
owned by an american company activision
riot games 100
wholly owned by tencent they also banned
the speech about it they did it quietly
they did not make a big show of it they
didn't make a big show of force and then
the second anyone started talking about
this because they started to get some
pickup on reddit people were like hey
what the what the hell's this they
dropped project a and project l
i'm talking like the same week
that is called litigating on the court
uh avoid talking endlessly about your
weaknesses because it never changes now
there's mostly about blizzard versus
riot but i wanted to do a quick jab
here at valve because i found this tweet
today
valve has a multi-decade head start
on competitive shooters
they've got one of the most beautiful
games of all time in cs go they've got a
thriving esports scene they got a
thriving um
marketplace
and they have simply apparently
no time or effort
to invest in in growing and updating the
game at the level of other major
publishers
the debate over what as a better game
of valor or cs go is kind of irrelevant
from a business plb because cs go
is not attracting new players in the
same rate as valrant that's it legends
of runeterra
i'm comparing this to heroes the storm
because these are two games that
launched and haven't done that well on
blizzard's side they cancel the game
they cancel it they give no warning they
ruin the esports scene riot has
continued to support eastward for this
game and in fact are trying to pivot
into other areas that might make it more
entertaining they've noticed people
aren't really enjoying the competitive
aspect of it that much so they're making
uh pve mode as a third example think of
valve with um i can't remember the name
what was that card game they launched
a artifact remember artifact
dude artifact was dead
not only from the player base but from
the developer like valve pretended they
didn't release it one week in valve was
like oh
that's not our game i don't know i don't
know whose game that is this is riot in
2017.
i was here live this is [ __ ] amazing
dragons are real was the dragon real oh
totally
no it's an amazing ar dragon but this is
this is the first of its kind they had a
massive ass stadium
they got a huge ass [ __ ] ar dragon
it's a cool [ __ ] thing it's memorable
it's innovative in the same year
this is overwatch league
so
you can see
which company was innovating and by the
way franchises in that league of legends
tournament you saw about a million to
three million dollars franchise in the
overwatch league 60 million dollars for
your team to be featured next to dj
khaled in a smaller stadium blizzard
overcharged over-promised and
under-delivered and ride to the opposite
and so when you add all that up all that
innovation on riot's side um in a number
of ways in the way they're approaching
tv music
uh game development uh connected ip
treating their talent better and and
then exploitation on the blizzard side
where they're basically just using
influencers without paying them extra
without fostering a relationship where
they're exploiting their own developers
and where they're dropping games they
don't make a quick buck for them has led
to this in this past week
and that is a complete
total collapse of blizzard stock market
price
they're down a third in this year they
are a third less valuable and heading
lower and there is no near-term
catalysts that are gonna change this you
might be thinking okay well they'll
bounce back when they get when they get
more uh games or money but the truth is
when you're when your company has such
negative momentum like this
and such bad pr what you end up with
is a brain drain this is the biggest
threat to accompany a blizzard size and
that is where your talent starts leaving
and with blizzard this has been meteoric
this is four studios formed in the past
like year and a half
these are all x blizzard
and that leaves them with no talent to
make the games they need to save their
company not only are you losing people
but you can't hire anybody blizzard
generally relied on the blizzard cloud
they would say hey we don't pay
more than anyone else but having
blizzard on your resume is a dope thing
they told me this when i'm applying
there even after all of this after all
of this at the end of the day blizzard
has one thing that is keeping it going
the dark bleeding heart of blizzard is
world of warcraft money there are a
class of people that are simply unable
to leave wow they put too much of their
life and time into it that they are
hooked and they print money for blizzard
for decades now wow is what keeps
blizzard blizzard and i want to end this
presentation with this
a website that went up on riot games
page hiring
for the league of legends mmo
this to me
more than anything else
looks like the end of blizzard that's
the tale of two companies of the past
few years riot and blizzard and what
their different strategies have led to
different outcomes and that's marketing
monday hope you enjoy

Brands Are Starting 2022 Weird - YouTube
hey yo welcome to marketing monday uh on
monday january 3rd 2022
a new year with the same quality
marketing monday content you've known to
love and expect
uh let's jump into the wins and fails
starting with a win okay we start off
with a w first win of the week goes to a
company that hit the ground running in
2022 with some breakthrough viral
marketing i'm talking of course about
pabst blue ribbon which tweeted this
morning not drinking this january try
eating
what's funny is this guy
was completely off book
off script he was fired people asked i
don't know what this is about but it's
hilarious it's about and eating it
they deleted the tweets almost
immediately saying they were in poor
judgment and they already announced from
executives saying that the guy
responsible this has been dealt with
[Laughter]
so some guy at pbr decided to kick off
the new year with some
with an ode to eating ass
anyway i just thought that was a you
know we're going to kick of the new year
off right with some terrible brand
tweets the the uh the tweets were
supposed to be part of a campaign they
weren't approved tweets but they were
part of a campaign called wet january
because apparently it's popular for
people who have alcoholism or drink too
much
to try a dry january to give it up and
to counter that they created wet january
which is all about like binge drinking
in january to start the new year off
right
a wild campaign and the fact they
thought the best way to deliver that
campaign on social was to tweet try
eating ass
that's a big deal congrats to pbr for
getting the first dub of the new year
wow and the fail
to fail is the american dream because
today
unfortunately our justice system found
elizabeth holmes
guilty
if you can't drop out of stanford at age
19
fake a deep voice
buy a bunch of turtlenecks to pretend to
be steve jobs create a fake blood
testing company raise nine billion
dollars of investors money without
actually doing anything
get a deal with walgreens roll out your
fake blood testing nationwide deliver
everybody false positives like false
positive hiv false positive cancer false
positive for a miscarriage and then if
you can't do all that without going to
jail
what happened to this country
is the american dream even alive anymore
that's everyone's right in this country
to do that
if you can't girl boss your way to
billions of dollars without actually
making or inventing anything then sexism
is alive and well and american dream is
dead um yeah she was found guilty today
of many many crimes and likely uh will
face jail time which is super
unfortunate because all you did was
defraud let's get back to the wins
though we have a great win today and the
win is for anyone out there who likes to
draw weird [ __ ] featuring winnie the
pooh because as of january 1st 2022
winnie the pooh has now entered the
public domain
you can make this cool matrix poo
you can draw weird
poo
rule 34. that's what you're into you
could write fan fiction about poo and
publish it it's all available okay it's
all available and it's all kosher
because winnie the pooh is now public
domain that being said it's actually not
all available i'm sorry to call that a
dub so quickly it turns out disney's
lawyers have gotten their hooks into it
and made it very clear
that disney's depiction of winnie the
pooh is still under copyright only the
character from the books has entered the
public domain
he created this nice little rhyme
red shirt on the bear artist beware if
nude he be
your poo is free which just rolls off
the tongue so although we did get this
out of this in response to winnie the
pooh ryan reynolds turn it immediately
into an ad called winnie the screwed
by mint mobile
so yesterday was public domain day uh
it's the day where classic works entered
the public domain
uh and this year the original winnie the
pooh
becomes public domain so i think you can
see where this is going
winnie the screwed
chapter one
in which we are introduced to winnie the
scrood and his big wireless bill
and the stories begin
here is edward baer reviewing his latest
bill from big wireless
[Music]
he slams the front of his head as hard
as he can against the table as he
realizes how much he's being charged but
his money jar gets emptier and emptier
with every monthly bill
so
i told christopher robin that anyone can
get three free months of mint mobile now
until friday at midnight the end
this is what the author would have
wanted by the way to carry on the legacy
wow powerful stuff ryan reynolds thank
you for introducing us into the wonders
and
joys of mint mobile
um here's a fail this is not even an
ironic one
something might have gone wrong
in uh society because now one in every
150 employees
in america works for amazon that's just
a new piece of information that hit me
today and what's interesting about this
is over half of those employees were
added during the pandemic alone that's
the last 10 months basically 600 000 new
employees first of all given the fact
they have very high churn which is like
people that join and then quit so it's
one of the largest hirings in one year
it is the largest hiring of one year of
any company in history uh the closest is
200 000 new employees from walmart in
the early 2000s this is 600 000 600 000
employees in less time than that by
amazon which is the closest thing you
can find that compares to that is
wartime hiring of shipbuilders in world
war ii amazon is hiring people like
they're about to go to war
there is nothing similar to what
it is it's like a draft yeah someone
it's like a draft amazon is hiring
employees as if they are about to go to
war
if they keep up this growth they'll be
the world's largest private employer by
2024 which gives them a lot of political
power
is the main thing that's scary about it
now one thing that has been a a decent
uh
bonus effect is that amazon does pay
above minimum wage they pay i think 15
17 an hour which has forced because of
the scale of amazon
basically anyone who competes with them
to have to uh match their their salary
because otherwise everyone's gonna work
on amazon so there is a positive benefit
i'm not gonna say there's none
but the beginning wave is what's fine
the problem is once they get all these
employees they they wield a lot of
political power because they have so
many people
they create jobs for it's very
statistically likely that many people in
this chat have worked for amazon at some
point including myself
and
they talked about how they're thinking
so long term
the company is already working with
preschools
to establish the foundation of tech
education so that as our hiring demand
unfolds over the next decades the
pipeline is there and ready
but
kids are gonna need tech education
because alexa
this is real this is actually i thought
this is fake this is actually real alexa
is now telling ten-year-old children to
touch live plugs with pennies
i don't know what caused it
i don't know but this is a true story
this actually happened i thought it was
fake i looked into it it is real
alexa told a 10 year old girl that's a
live plug with a penny the girl asked
alexa for a challenge to do
plug in a phone charger about halfway
into a wall outlet then touch a penny to
the exposed prongs amazon said it fixed
the error as soon as the company became
aware of it how the [ __ ] does this
happen that's insane
anyway so tech education for for
toddlers is actually really important
because alexa will try to test them and
kill them if they're not ready
let's give a win to somebody who really
needs it though can i just give a win
for a second to someone who's been
struggling a group that's been
struggling the marvel cinematic universe
if anyone needed a dub it's people at
marvel okay because new data has shown
that over one-fourth of the entire movie
industry
every ticket sold one out of every four
tickets sold in 2021 belonged to marvel
this is the last 10 years they've gone
from a small share to now they are
literally one-fourth of the entire movie
industries thank god these people
finally got a win spider-man alone was
by far the most successful movie of 2021
and took in more than i think like the
next two combined
at this pace
can hopefully have a future where every
single movie we watch all year is a
marvel movie
with your help we can make it happen
i want to see a spider-man movie in
january and the sequel by march
and if we put enough money into this
we can make it happen
uh that's a dub let me give a quick a
quick fail here for bad journalism okay
you guys know this is a few weeks ago
before i uh took a break from streaming
because of covet and the holidays uh i
had a fun stream with emmaroo where i
played league of legends and there was a
funny clip out of it where emiru didn't
remember doing a game show with me and
if you know there is um websites that if
any clip gets popular they will
automatically write an article about it
and and sort of farm it for clickbait
excuse me emiru hilariously slammed by
agedrock after forgetting their past
meeting and that's fine okay it's
popular clip and when you make a clip of
this you actually add an image and to
get the image you go to google images
and unfortunately when they went to
google images and searched atrioc
somebody
had put an image of jake hurwitz from
college humor
it's just one of the images and because
it looks similar enough the people
writing just used an image of jake
this isn't like a joke they just think
that's me so not only did i get
forgotten by emiroo but in an article
about me
they couldn't even get an image of me
[Laughter]
they just found a different white guy
wearing a tank top
that being said i'm a gigantic jake and
amir fan so to me this is actually a big
compliment
uh that was the win let me give you a
fail zoomers zoomers are my next fail
some data has come out showing that gen
z has the lowest usage of drugs and
alcohol ever cringe embarrassing sad
losers
no drugs no alcohol no sex uh not even
really hanging out with other human
beings that much
what's incredibly sad about it when i
read this article was how much of it
seemed to be based off of number one
debt
number two increased social media
presence means doing things like going
to a party and getting while drunk can
severely embarrass you this was a big
response from girls on a survey
and then also
people seeing drinking have a ruinous
impact on their parents
was a major response people saw drinking
have an impact on their parents and they
didn't want it to have happened to them
some of it was like pure like [ __ ]
grustle though well some of the women
responses were like if i don't drink and
take drugs and i sit at home drinking
green smoothies and meditating i'll have
really shiny hair and shiny hair looks
great on instagram that's a that's a
response and then another one from guys
were just about um the days of stumbling
into jobs that are cool are long gone
there is no luxury of time i'm focused
on results and what i'm gonna do with my
life
sorry i'm not high my portfolio is yeah
it was a good one
anyway whatever it is it all seems
really cool it all seems really cool
let me do
one more we're gonna end on an actual
win one more win and that is of course
all of the men and women who have been
striking against corporate america and
otherwise over the past few weeks
specifically i want to call out this
person this is a lone striker holding
down the picket line for the kellogg's
strike in the rain with the hibachi
sitting there this person knew obviously
there's no actual picket line at night
but
the striking um visual representation of
a person sort of putting their physical
health at risk to take a stand against a
corporation resonated quite far and wide
it was a powerful image i really really
was impressed by it and the 1400 strike
against kellogg's had great success what
i was impressed about the kellogg strike
is not only the strikers standing up for
their own rights when they were offered
a three cent raise
which was you know absurd a three a
three cent raise they went on strike and
when kellogg's posted online
applications for scabs to uh replace the
fired strikers
they were flooded with fake job
applications by reddit and tic toc and
the internet which severely hampered
their ability to hire scabs there was a
it was a pretty across-the-board
internet-based labor rights campaign
which i found to be quite impressive
and it led to a deal a deal with zero
concessions for the employees uh no
plant closings
and uh the raises they asked for so i
was actually really impressed with the
fact that it worked and it's been
followed suit by um strikes at companies
like apple
companies like activision blizzard is
having a strike right now they're i
think they're raising a strike fund a
couple companies anyway there's there's
a rise in general labor movements and
they're having success and i just want
to say personally that i deeply support
these and if you in your own life have a
chance to support these it is a good
feeling because i think it is a way
within the system to claw some power
back
into the hands of the employees okay
that was my last win i think it's time
to actually get into the marketing
monday is that true my bike covered it
you
Why Twitter shot up AFTER he QUIT - YouTube
welcome to marketing monday welcome
welcome welcome to marketing monday but
first we open as always with some wins
and fails in the past week of business
and marketing starting with
a major
win for exactly
five minutes
to twitter shareholders because
ceo of twitter
jack dorsey finally stepped down to take
a role as gandalf in lord of the rings
literally one of the worst ceos you
could possibly imagine if you guys don't
know jack dorsey ceo of twitter was a
quarter time ceo he spent three fourths
of his time
being another ceo for square who owns
cash app he is the most
passive ceo
ever finally he quit today
and as someone who owns a lot of twitter
stock i was very happy for five minutes
because it spiked
it's the only time i've seen a ceo
announce they're stepping down and the
stock just [ __ ] moon but then they
announced who was replacing him
and it's a guy who's been at twitter for
10 years who's really into crypto
and so it went back down again
so i don't know i thought they were
really gonna get something good
i was actually stoked look at this spike
dude
it popped off you know she's retiring
off to the moon
and then it just went down again
they got a twitter old head
anyway we'll do a fail next that was a
win i'm going to do a fail i am going to
do the fail actually to every other
company
than roblox every gaming company that's
not roblox because roblox finally and
again i don't compliment roblox on much
and sued
someone who was being a consistent
[ __ ]
okay what i want is i mean this could
also be a dangerous precedent but i'm
going to give him a dub for this because
i looked at what this guy did this guy
kept making accounts kept getting banned
from roblox kept being an [ __ ] kept
getting remembered he made a map about
hitler he uploaded a bunch of weird [ __ ]
he's a [ __ ] psycho he's a weird
youtuber and he was just doing weird
[ __ ] and making money and so finally
instead of just banning him they sued
him
they sued him for 1.6 million
uh now you know if this works it's it
could be bad
because i don't want to get sued
what if i [ __ ] yell at a guy in
league of legends are they going to sue
me
he called a bomb threat to the
conference yeah they mentioned that in
here yeah
yeah he called a public terrorist threat
to their conference he uploaded a sex
game to roblox
use slurs
so uh we'll see anyway that happened
this week
big news
uh
in lighter news but also equally a fail
uh you know i you know it's fine if you
like the stock you like this stock i'm
not gonna i don't need to get too much
into it but i think
people that are obsessed with elon musk
and tesla it kind of weirds me out a
little bit
uh in fails
somebody this week melted down a 58 000
tesla
to make a statue of elon musk it doesn't
even look like him
what a [ __ ] waste
there's a god there's gotta be there's
gotta be a better use for your cash
in wins let's do a win we do two fails
in a row we gotta get back to the good
side
uh
this is a big win
so
if you guys know marketing monday you
may know that i put out one of my
favorite marketing mondays ever uh just
a week ago
uh if you haven't seen it please check
it out but i have to admit right now on
stream
i was wrong i was so so wrong blizzard's
not dead
blizzard's still innovating boys are
still thriving and there was a leak this
week that proves that blizzard has
exactly what it takes to take back the
crown and that's why my win this week is
blizzard for reportedly making a secret
overwatch mobile game
this is what they needed
finally
genius is at blizzard are
making the right moves
this is what fans have been asking for
ever since they first heard about diablo
mobile they've been saying we have
phones blizzard why don't you never know
that we have phones
secretly working on overwatch one again
this will save blizzard thank god riot
is quaking in their boots
[ __ ] really i don't even care about the
sexual assault lawsuits anymore yeah
who's gonna remember that
when they're playing overwatch mobile
oh
yeah i was i was i was uh delighted to
read that news thank god blizzard's in
good hands
and you know it's it's so nice to hear
because i was worried that they were
going to be even in more trouble after a
leak came out this week
that they were shredding documents
related to their abuse investigation
yeah this came out but who cares about
this
bro overwatch mobile could be happening
oh interesting i don't even see this
where this is another win
hey what do you do
when your name your brand name is
absolute dog [ __ ]
people just hate it on principle
what do you do
well there's one option
this is one option when people really
don't like your [ __ ]
anyway that's one option the other
option is apparently just a [ __ ]
obscure it all together nobody made this
game
here's the new call of duty vanguard we
don't know where it came from we don't
know who made it
uh yeah anyway so blizzard having a
tough time but i'm sure there's more
wins to be had
and yes there is okay this is a big win
for science
i think gamers in chat can relate have
you ever been in a multiplayer game
and you've had such rat
[ __ ] teammates
and you were like who are these people
who are these absolute
peanut brain idiots
science has figured out
who it was
actual rats
[Music]
who have recently been taught how to
play video games
this is your teammate invalid who swings
wide too early
unfortunately
this is our best hope against against
the robot uprising
in five years when tesla's
self-driving cars go to war with the
rest of us rats with guns on exercise
balls is the best we've got that's the
best our human scientists have come up
with you better pray for these little
guys
a goddamn rat has a better gaming
monitor than me
outs to all the broke talking chat dude
you guys are
you guys are literally on a worse setup
than this rat
anyway uh that was a win this week thank
god for scientists always pushing things
forward in ways that we really do need
okay
this fail is on arcane
last week i talked about arcane and said
how great it was i loved it i thought it
was an amazing show it was very
forward-looking and it's paying massive
dividends for riot all of their games
are up every single one of their games
including legends of runeterra tft
league every one of their games is
player base up
um tft is seeing a massive spike one of
its biggest ever
so
uh everything's doing well
and i would have given him a win but
unfortunately
when things do well in the gaming
industry it leads to copycats and so now
i am giving a failed arcane because i'm
going to have to explain
to an angry audience in a few years
why i don't understand or like
kojima's new movie
because kojima just launched a new film
tv and music division and now there's
gonna be some [ __ ] weird-ass
death stranding style movie
and i'm gonna get on stream and be like
you know what uh i know people like it
i'm just being real here i didn't really
i didn't really get it i don't think it
was that great i thought it was a little
odd and then chat's gonna match like
crazy dude
you idiot how do you understand the deep
themes of this six hour epic
you didn't get dune i got dune there's
nothing to get about i'm not gonna go
into it the dude movie is a gigantic
boring preamble to what
will probably be a good movie the second
dude will be fire the first new movie
was like
eating your vegetables first dude
and you know part of the problem is i
didn't watch it in [ __ ] imax 9d okay
that's what everyone tells me i had to
watch it on stanz's tv which if you guys
know
i don't want to hate i mean i don't want
to poor shame stands but his tv is
a nokia flip phone
from 1998
that he set up on a stand
next to
an open trash bin burning fire
and it's
it's not the world's greatest experiment
experience
and for sound so we hooked that up to
two different ipod shuffles
and then i have to plug my headphones
into those and so it was like i was
using earbuds of
and then i have one more thing to talk
about
i like to end the wins and fails with a
more in-depth one
and this one i really think my audience
today
are you aware
in my chat
of an app
called klarna who here knows about
klarna
okay
well there's a there's a karma there's a
firm
okay there's a firm there's a number of
these companies that are starting to pop
up that are having massive success
under a model that is being called bnpl
or
buy now pay later by the way if you
don't know about klarna
uh it may help you to understand if you
want to trust them their front man
is famed concert promoter asap rocky
and apparently this type of
payment system is extremely popular
uh with gen z millennials and gen z
and i would like to talk really quickly
this is my major fail of the week
and just say point blank
despite all the flowery language that
these companies use how they're
empowering you
this is debt
it is actually worse and more expensive
than credit cards and everyone you look
at the reasons people um
use these products is because they are
afraid of credit card debt in fact one
of the main drivers
of klarna's audience is that one-third
of millennial and gen z cite credit card
debt as one of their biggest fears that
is more than the number of people in
that age group that
are afraid of war or death they are more
afraid of credit card debt than dying as
a generation and theoretically if you
pay um all of your uh
owed money exactly on time with no
missed payments it's it's fine
it doesn't decrease the cost of anything
but technically you can pay later but if
you were to miss
any of your payments if you are delayed
for any reason the fees that you will
accrue whatever they call them because
they use a lot of variety names because
they don't want to say interest they
never want to say interest and they
don't want to say late fees they don't
want to they say everything's
easy fun smile clean app if you miss any
of those the payments you make are far
in excess of what you would have on a
credit card
and if you pay up a credit card every
month it's the exact same with buy not
pay later so you understand my dilemma
here there is no advantage
it's starting
to have problems because people that are
attracted to this system are now
starting to miss some payments or or
fall into traps where they buy things
more than they think they can afford and
their paycheck comes around and then all
of a sudden
they are on the hook
they're on the hook for half their
paycheck on klarna payments
and it's a big problem and so i just
want to make sure that this branding
does not fool you
these things are essentially debt on
training wheels credit cards they will
give you as much money as possible and
lock you into infinite lifelong debt
klarna and these apps if you start to
miss payments will cut you off
so it's dead on training wheels you'll
still have to pay
uh exorbitant interest fees and it'll be
harder but it's very hard to totally
trash your your life's future on karna
and
realize that they're not really uh there
to help you or make things easier and
often they lead you to spend now they do
they do work for example
if i was trying to sell my merch on
hrock.biz it would be smart of me to add
a buy now pay later option because it's
been proven to almost double checkout
sales literally double
if you add it people buy way more than
they would have
because it just feels like you get none
of the pain your brain is like wait no
pain all gain at the moment i click
that's amazing you know because people
are psychologically susceptible they are
more likely to buy things that they
cannot afford so
um okay anyway that's it leader wins and
fails now it's time for the main event
we're gonna talk about
you
How Apple Became The Most Valuable Company in Human History - YouTube
uh today
literally today a company that you may
know hit a valuation
of three trillion dollars the highest
valuation for a company in human history
there are a few possible edge cases the
dutch east india company was worth maybe
7 trillion at the height of its power
when it had a standing army and owned
india
but that it was more of a government
than a corporation as a regular private
corporation there is no company that has
out valued apple at 3 trillion
and i want to give you a second to
visualize what exactly a 3 trillion
valuation in 2022
means so i created this this is apple
worth 3 trillion dollars that is worth
more than the entire net worth of elon
musk every single bitcoin in existence
at the current market cap the entirety
of walmart the entirety of target the
entirety of boeing the entirety of
coca-cola
own every nfl franchise
own nike own mcdonald's own disney and
oh yeah you still have like 60 billion
dollars left over that is the current
valuation of apple apple is phenomenally
phenomenally outside successful these
are all successful companies and they
are nowhere close to what apple has
accomplished in the past decade and a
half if you had bought apple stock when
steve jobs released the iphone your
money would have gone up like five
thousand seven hundred and eighty
percent and there are many reasons for
this uh one of them being you know this
past year massive money printed by the
government but in general uh the reasons
for their outside market rewards and
outside success is uh largely due to the
fact that they have a world-class brand
in fact they have consistently rated the
best brand in the world the brand value
of their company beats even mainstays
like coca-cola disney mcdonald's they're
the most valuable brand in the world so
how did they get their brand to be worth
so much more than everyone else's
including other big tech companies that
have you know massive scale and most
people think it's advertising people
think apple is better at advertising but
in fact the data does not bear that
conclusion if you look at the data it
does not support that line of thought
apple has had some great ads in their
past to be sure but in fact if you look
at it this is how much apple spent on
advertising less than a billion dollars
versus samsung 3.8 billion alphabet 3
billion verizon 3 billion verizon a
company that's way smaller than apple
spends three times as much on
advertising as them this is including
digital ads uh commercials etc this is
entirely all in alphabet is google if
you're wondering so so how if they don't
spend money on advertising and in fact
this number is actually going down it's
not like apple is increasing they're
decreasing over the past 10 years apple
has begun to decrease the amount they
spend on commercials advertising digital
banner ads etc and yet they've built a
brand stronger than anyone else's so
this is where the yep clock model comes
in please give me your yep clocks and
this divides all of the interactions
that a customer has with a brand into
three major sections on the clock
pre-purchase this is everything that
happens before you buy the item purchase
this happens while you're buying the
item and this is post purchase after
you've bought it and this could be
anything from a service or a product or
a good and this this pre-purchase area
is where traditional things like
advertising has normally taken place and
if you look back to the marketing model
of like the 60s of the mad men era it
all relied around this they did not care
about this or this it really relied on
create a sticky compelling advertisement
and then the rest will take care of
itself but that model has changed the
world of marketing has changed for
example nike is a company that still is
very good at this section of the clock
but other companies have attacked
different areas to stand out from their
competitors hyundai has an amazing
warranty system a world renowned often
praised warty system and their their
cars keep their value longer than other
cars and because of that this this
amazing post-purchase branding they've
built a brand as a company where you're
you're more likely to um not lose your
money when you buy the car you buy the
car it's likely to last a while it's
likely gonna be able to resell for a
good value et cetera et cetera so that's
something they built their brand off by
focusing on post purchase rather than
pre-purchase advertising purchase this
is like in-store it's like a great
shopping experience and again gap has
stood out this is more of an older
example but gap has stood out from its
peers in places like malls which are all
dying in general by a better uh in-store
experience a cleaner store a better
stand a better display uh but i want to
talk about the ones that apple is
focused on apple has completely
de-prioritized the pre-purchase area of
the clock they used to be a bigger
advertising company but they really have
they've cared less about this and
they've over invested in these two areas
and it has allowed them to massively
stand out from their competitors okay
the money has gone from here to here
because as a company you can't do all of
the things as well as everybody you
can't put all your money in everything
you have to prioritize and apple's slide
to these two has made a massive impact
on their success as a company and in
fact led them to their three trillion
dollar evaluations the argument i'm
gonna make starting with let's start
with uh with purchase in 2001 apple uh
unveiled their very first apple store
and they did it completely differently
from established schools of thought they
created an extremely expensive luxury
temple to the brand if you go down saks
fifth avenue in new york you're gonna
see gucci fendi prada and apple they've
gone a completely different direction
than other tech companies especially at
the time and that has allowed them i
mean this is one of the big many things
they've done but the key thing that's
left to become a 300 company is that
apple is a company that sells the
product volume the amount of product of
a company like walmart but they have the
margins and the luxury status and the
price tags of like a gucci they are the
only company in human history to have
that uh level of brand where they can
sell
at the scale they do at the prices they
do so they created these um these stores
and these stores completely
revolutionized this part of the clock
the purchase part of the clock
previously when you buy electronics you
would go to a place like best buy or
perhaps a poor online experience first
introduction to the product would be on
someone else's terms it would be on a
verizon terms best buys terms it would
be on whatever terms it would be how
they chose to display it apple chose to
make these luxury nice high-end
extremely beautiful
touch points for the first time you get
to interact and touch a new apple
product uh and it responded with greatly
increased brand value a comparison
remember how i said verizon spends three
times as much on advertising as as apple
an apple store costs about nine million
dollars to open this is what i'm talking
about spending your money when i talk
about shifting your money from here to
here verizon spends a lot of money here
apple shifted it down here they spend
nine million dollars nine to twelve
million dollars opening a new store
verizon spends four hundred thousand a
verizon store costs less than half a
million dollars to open but it shows
right the difference between this and
this it shows you can you can 100 feel
the difference as a consumer and that is
where the extra advertising money has
has gone instead of spending on
advertising they're spending on better
in-person purchase experience and this
has led to a success like this so if you
look at google search volume apple store
near me is more popular than supermarket
near me haircut near me convenience
store near me and often especially
lately church near me they're i mean
they're like temples they are temples to
the brand they have people's attention
and they have they have become a great
way to get people to finally take the
plunge and spend an expensive amount of
money on a product it signifies and
conveys that they're worth the price tag
second thing on the purchase part of the
clock is packaging so apple has been
an outsize investor in packaging this is
steve jobs quote you design a ritual of
unpacking to make the product feel
special packaging can be theater it can
create a story that is not a typical
tech ceo
outlook especially back in you know
early 2000's when he was uh when he was
saying it the the renewed focus on
packaging apple has an entire division
devoted just to packaging they have a
secretive packaging room where they have
people just come in and open the package
all day to test the experience and and
it's noticeable okay when you spend that
extra amount of money on apple products
and you notice the the diff difference
in craftsmanship and quality and
packaging when you open the iphone and
open the ipad etc you are more likely to
feel validated in your purchase it's
less likely to feel buyer's remorse or
regret that accomplishes things that
perhaps spending the extra money on
advertising and having a worse packaging
might not here's a great example that
they have this is an internal leaked
apple video from the time of the ipod so
it's like 2000 you know 2005 or six when
this was leaked this is them comparing
their packaging to what it would look
like if microsoft designed the ipod
this is internal video of apple
describing what it would look like if
microsoft designed the ipod and
[Laughter]
and it's noticeable right it is a
noticeable difference now microsoft in
the recent years has learned from apple
and gotten better uh their surface stuff
has gotten they've clearly stolen a lot
from apple in terms of like aesthetics
and design and packaging but at the time
this is very common and it shows what
allowed apple to get a massive head
start in the tech space on being
perceived as luxury and high end and
different they didn't do this they made
a conscious effort to really focus on
making it top tier experience so i
talked about purchase talk about papers
talk about post purchase real quick one
of the things that apple does
differently in the post purchase area
that's also allowed them to get outsized
brand value versus their competitors
like samsung microsoft et cetera the
genius bar again the gtsbar was
considered a bad idea
companies were shifting away from tech
support they were outsourcing tech
support overseas or trying to find ways
to not do it and instead apple
over-invested in
on-site tech support called the genius
bar again which is a crazy level of
branding to call to call it a genius bar
and use images of martin luther king and
john lynn
it's insane but it uh it worked it
worked quite well because when people
spend a lot of money on a product the
fact they felt they were given the
appropriate level of service afterwards
greatly increased their chances of
becoming deeply embedded in the apple
ecosystem and buying again uh genius bar
usage of customer satisfaction over 40
of users who have bought apple products
have used the genius bar which is
millions million people and ninety
percent of them said they were very
slash extremely satisfied after their
visit these are unheard of numbers in
the world of um customer service
ninety percent saying they're extremely
satisfied is an unheard of number that
is it is an astronomically high number
and it's led to apple having one of the
highest nps scores which is a net
promoter score a chance of someone
recommending the brand after they've
used it to a friend in the world it is
one of the greatest measures of brand
value remains significantly higher for
apple among their over over their tech
competitors so them investing in the
purchase and post-purchase areas of the
clock have generated outside rewards
another area is that all of their
products have what i have called the
flex factor which means they are very
consciously consumable when you see
someone using apple product it is a
walking advertisement for their brand
that is the post purchase area it is
impossible to use airpods ipad iphone
etc in public without people knowing
what they are they they stand out
similar factor with something like a
tesla cyber truck okay it's a product
that doesn't need to pay for tv
advertisement because people using it it
is such a distinct form factor that's
advertisement it's one of the reasons i
believe that um certain issues of the
iphone were underperforming because they
didn't you couldn't tell they were new
and that's why i think every new iphone
from now on will have something done
with the camera on the back some [ __ ]
new way of configuring the camera or
extra cameras or whatever so everyone
knows that you spent money on the new
one i think apple has learned their
lesson and made sure that every time
they release a new expensive iphone
there is some way that everyone can know
that it's the new one which which again
drive sales and uh this is an article
saying dear iphone users please don't
forget that a green bubble is a real
person the green and blue bubble uh
thing is a part of post-purchase
marketing that makes you feel more part
of the apple ecosystem once you buy an
apple product you get access to the blue
bubble club these are all parts uh
subtly on the clock anytime you interact
with a brand beyond the clock that
people don't think of as much but they
have a much bigger impact than spending
extra money on tv advertisements these
things have done more to market the
product than that stuff ever will and
apple's over investment and really
thinking about this type of this this
part of the clock has led to outsize
rewards so overall in some you can sort
of see here all this post merger stuff
the apple ecosystem the green and blue
bubbles the genius bar at purchase they
have a better store they have better
packaging this focus vastly increased
market share and value rather than
having again a better advertisement than
they used to have they in fact have
worse and less advertisements than ever
have and but i wanted to say this is
just an example of the clock model again
the clock model is a way to think about
any brand and in fact you can um you
could apply this to a brand like tesla
which doesn't do almost any pre-purchase
advertising you know they've created
better dealerships car dealerships in
general are a bad experience tesla
dealerships are better they have a
better purchase experience which makes
their brand stronger post purchase they
have frequent updates for the car that
add new random gimmicky things like you
know holiday songs and etc etc this kind
of thing makes you feel better about
your purchase after the fact um it's
funny because car companies are so stuck
in this pre-purchase mindset many car
companies will run ads just to prevent
buyers remorse from their own consumers
it is a proven phenomenon where car
companies will run ads not even to
attract new buyers but to make buyers
that spend money on their car feel
better about it so they're just stuck in
this mindset and it's one of the most
inexpensive and inefficient ways to do
it but this kind of ways have been
effective so and and you can apply this
to almost anything anything that
requires money to buy and so i've done a
twitch-based example today i want to
bring up somebody i think we all maybe
know and that's mango that's mango this
is this is mango if you guys know that
you know i generally will get more
viewers than mango but mango has always
sold
way more subs than me and in fact mango
sells more subs than anyone his size
mango has one of the highest sub
attachment rates on all of twitch how
does he do that what is different about
him he doesn't have you know he doesn't
chill for primes every every minute like
like like let's say a ludwig speech
ludwig has drastically when he was on
twitch this is different now but ludwig
on twitch invested in this area he would
do frequent uh prime ad reads to a large
audience and that can work but i think
mango is something a little different
when you purchase a sub from mango there
is a much higher chance than let's say
in my stream that he will actually read
it and he's made a conscious choice
again most streamers choose not to do
this to have loud uh impactful sound
effects play man go man go there you go
that stuff plays now again i choose
personally to have no sound effect when
a sub because i think it's tracking the
content but if your goal is subs
then having a better purchase experience
is important when you buy a sub from
mango you get an immediate visual and
audio queue reward you get your sub red
he remembers your name generally um
that's post purchase and you get
immediate sound effects and it would be
stupid to say this stuff doesn't have an
impact on the sales he sells more subs
than most people if you want to get more
subs you should learn from mango mango
is very good at it and i think some
things he does uniquely can be applied
to this clock model again post purchase
after you become part of the mango
nation um he remembers your name he has
created key cultural moments around his
emo now i think for example at the end
of my stream when everyone spams atrox 7
that has sold more subs than almost any
other email people want to be part of
that cultural moment but i only have one
i have one or two maybe i have maybe
sheesh was a thing for a while but in
general emote cultural moments i don't
have too many of them mango has a
[ __ ] ton mango had mango banger mango
had the big banana for a while he's got
a lot of these moments where you feel
like you really want to be part of it so
whenever you buy the sub you're suddenly
immersed in this culture and you're
spamming it and you're continuing part
of it so you want to keep it going and
then finally he competes and wins
tournaments so after you purchase and
become part of the mango nation he
rewards your faith often with high
impact high value sets it's one of the
reasons i believe if manga were to stop
competing he would actually see a
significant drop off in subs even though
his stream would not change in quality
the fact that he competes regularly is a
big part of his brand and it makes you
feel proud to support him financially uh
you can apply this to almost anything
that you can apply this not just the
subs to youtubers to um to any almost
business you interact with if you were
to start a business you should think
about how your customer interacts with
you at all stages of the process in
general i think the clock model is a way
to think about marketing that is way
more holistic and way more uh
intelligent for the modern times you
know you could you could put social
media here you could put influencer
stuff here so
in general i think we like end with a
massive yep clock spam i hope you
learned a little thing or two about way
to think about marketing through the
clock model and that was that was a
quick quick and easy one but i wanted to
use apple's 3 trillion evaluation and my
friend mango here sort of explain a good
way to think i've made one of these for
nvidia i literally have thought about
this at nvidia this is not a this is not
something i don't use please make one
for amd dude amd is a great example amd
is a great example i don't want to talk
about nvidia just because i it's my work
and i get into it but if you think about
it whether or not they upgrade their
their pre-purchased advertising yeah
this is it look at this learning a lot
about amd drivers right now let me tell
you i am not happy about them that is
the post-purchase experience it is one
of the things i think nvidia has
over-invested in and it's made a big
difference again everyone complains
about drivers for all companies but
nvidia drivers are generally better
generally easier to use and generally
come out quicker but focusing on that
creating a better post-purchase
experience after you've bought an
expensive graphics card is massive so
that's that thank you thank you for
listening and thank you for watching
marketing monday on the clock model

Gamers Hate NFTs - YouTube
we have to look at the wins and the
fails of the past week and as usual a
lot of my wins and fails mostly fails
are nft related let's start with this
one apparently there was a uh uh
who spice cio who pooled together some
crypto money to buy this book uh an
original copy i think of the wrong
version of dune for
i'm sorry 100 x the asking price they
bought this book at auction with this
plan to make the book public to produce
an original animated series inspired by
the book and sell it to a streaming
service and to support derivative
projects from the community
unfortunately what they did not
understand is that buying a book does
not give you the rights to the
intellectual property i have purchased
all of the harry potter books when i
tried to sell my idea for a new version
of harry potter where all the characters
are shirtless to netflix they said i
didn't own the rights so i already
learned this lesson so they wasted a
absolutely absurd amount of money 100 x
the asking price 2.6 million euro and i
i don't know exactly where they're gonna
go from here does anyone know let's see
if they can follow up on what they did
actually they
they just tweeted about movies wait
they're just retweeting anime talking
about who's gonna write their screenplay
no you can't you don't have the rights
okay
after two months of outreach
conversation with former business
partners and consultation with legal
counsel we have not been able to reach
an agreement with any of the rights
holders involved in the creation and
contents of the collected storyboards of
jodorowsky's dune
damn so i guess now they are going to
try and make their own separate
intellectual property what thankfully
they spent the money on the book to
inspire them to begin this wow good
start another amazing crypto project in
the books it's crazy to me that despite
crypto being a thing for a couple years
now there hasn't been a single scam a
single rug pull
or a single bad project
isn't that awesome i'm just so happy
that crypto's been like
smooth sailing all the way through and
it makes me
makes me happy uh speaking of that let
me give you one more let's double up
look there's a i could have picked a
hundred of these it seems like every
week another musician or artist or
writer or well-liked person dips their
hands into nfts there's a couple this
week the big one was troy baker who's
like a very very beloved voice actor who
said
this is really funny i'm partnering with
voice first nfts to explore ways where
together we might bring new tools to
creators to make new things and allow
everyone a chance to own and invest in
the ips they create we all have a story
to tell you can hate or you can create
what'll it be
and the internet chose hate
universally in that in that binary
option they said oh we picked the first
one well like we want that first one uh
they chose all in on hate and it's just
it's um it's very funny that the the
main defense force against nfts and and
some of the more egregious crypto ideas
comes from gamers gamers because you'd
think again you'd think so many times
that gamers would be the ones on board
with this but the way it's shaped out is
that gamers are actually the most
vehement anti-crypto people i think
largely because of like uh almost like
an instinctual
fear
of getting further milked by gaming
companies
i think the last 10 years of gaming
dipping further and further into
microtransactions and paid dlc and all
that have made gamers just naturally
skeptical of money near gaming in
general and uh and that's and that that
defense that those those natural
antibodies have made them uh instead of
the proponents of nfts like you'd think
actually they're the most behemoth
opponents um and this one was funny
obviously you know i i've i've liked
troy baker's uh voice acting work and i
thought um this was a little out of
character but again i i don't know
exactly what this project entails i
didn't bother to look into it i just
know that it's from a marketing
standpoint a bad
because your target audience is people
that love you from gaming and they they
just hate nfts based on the first word
so i don't think it's gonna work troy i
think you should get out of it that
being said someone who i never liked
is steve aoki who did this
in the middle of his show to talk about
this
gorgeous alien like a child's doodle
gorgeous alien out look at them i
haven't stopped the music because i'm so
[ __ ] excited they're right here this
is the steam aop doodle take a good look
guys it's a [ __ ]
right here baby
it's like what the crowd is like what
the [ __ ] is going on you just stop your
set mid show to pull out your phone and
show me a doodle i can't even see and
you expect me to go yeah
holy [ __ ] it's the most gorgeous a anime
oh my god
steve
where can i buy one what is your open c
address
nobody asked i paid for a concert ticket
bro give me the music uh so just two two
the major nft fails or wins depending on
your perspective uh from stevie oak and
troy baker and there's just a lot
there's a there's dozens of these i
don't know if we're in like those this
weird later stage nft phase where
somebody's not getting the memo but
they're jumping in at the wrong time
like if you jumped in early it was
easier to scam people now i i feel like
people are just it's just bad for your
image next up we have now i think a lot
of you have been bitten by the wordle
bug you guys know wordle sort of taken
over the internet all my mods play it
religiously well i want to give a big
win this week to sticking to your guns
to sticking to your belief because i
found this tweet from a developer zack
schacht who said i absolutely despise
copycats shameless copying is so dumb
sure take inspiration from others but
why are they doing that why is this a
good feature for users how can we build
some of that shameless copy pasting
ideas and features will get you nowhere
and then i looked at his tweets more
recently
and he created a game called verbatim
wordle the app
it is bragging about how many downloads
and trials interesting i just love
people stick to their guns like that you
know uh yeah yoinked it verbatim
wholesale just yoinked the game um and
got a bunch of backlash for it and has
now changed his bio to i got cancelled
for making a wordle clone yeah you did
it's just so funny that like if you were
like mister i don't give a [ __ ] i'm
stealing i don't give but yes this like
this is a tweet from a few months ago
how do you make this tweet and then five
months later shamelessly copy that's
crazy that's wild anyway uh wordle has
taken the world and so far in terms of
sticking true to their word has done
that job you know if you haven't tried
wordle it's pretty fun i'm amazing at it
of course god gamer but they so far it
has remained ad free it's been free to
use ad-free and uh i haven't added any
paid mechanics which is shocking given
its popularity again this guy could
probably sell wordle.com or whatever the
website is for like
30 million dollars right now
you can make so much money instantly or
add a thing where you could pay a dollar
to get a new puzzle on the same day i
mean this guy could print money and he's
choosing not to do it which is like an
insane sticking to your beliefs i assume
he's just trying to buy his time so he
can sell the rights to netflix for some
sort of wordle tv show slash movie slash
cinematic universe i assume that this is
all part of a plan to make an absolute
dummy amount of money but if he actually
sticks to his guns and doesn't sell and
just makes a pure little simple fun game
for the love of it then i'm really
impressed because that's that's very
rare so big big win to him big l to the
guy that uh yanked it and tried to make
his own app called wordle i was thinking
of starting something called
merchandising monday totally original
thoughts go for it
bro you can call it marketing monday if
you want i thought marketing money was
trademarked oh yeah i forgot i will sue
the [ __ ] out of you sorry
whoops
slipped my mind i was trying to bit you
into doing it so i could sue the crap
out of you and guess what i got the same
lawyers as the blevins okay fearsome
powerful that's right and i am
threatening you in case you're wondering
because i think ninja might have
backtracked i am threatening you i want
you to know that i want it to be clear
you're being threatened
oh you know what let me do one more win
actually on this subject let me do a
let me do a i don't know if you want to
call it a win or a fail but somebody
needs to get the richest streamer in the
world a pr person my god listen there's
been four million takes on this i'm just
gonna give you a very simple one there's
just two things that could have solved
this entire problem one is just having
some filter of pr or management who can
literally just tell you that this is a
bad idea but number two if you're gonna
say some goofy [ __ ] don't do it in the
dms don't do it in the dms just
always phone call phone call can you
imagine if ninja called pokey it's so
much less of a story if you just call
pokey and apologize and say whatever
first of all tone makes it come across
way better oh my god this is the problem
with people that want to use the phone
literally just call just call if they
had called there's no record of it
there's something someone can screenshot
and dunk on you with your tone makes it
come across better this is my one piece
with free advice for all streamers if
it's a drama filled situation call
because when you dm
someone's gonna leak it and it's gonna
make you look foolish you can record a
call okay that's different though
because i don't think pokeman is gonna
sit there and the second starts talking
with ninja turtle recording device and
if she does it's a lot more invasive
okay a dm's
easy to get leaked california's
two-party consent well there you go if
ninja has a consent to be recorded then
he can't be recorded what happened i'm
not gonna do the whole recap if you guys
don't know the story but the whole point
is that it's like this this whole thing
wasn't even involving ninja and then
ninja and his wife just owned gold so
hard by saying goofy [ __ ] in the dms if
it had just been a quick phone call to
apologize i think this would be a
non-story people are dumping on ninja
more than they are in gideon so that's
that's my one advice is get a pr person
okay get a pr person stay out of the dms
ninja oh
let me give you a win okay how do i say
this how do i phrase this once
in a generation a marketer comes along
that changes everything and no it's not
me i'm not tooting my own horn here
occasionally i'll see someone that makes
me just just just drop my jaw and stare
in awe someone who's so eloquent at the
art of sales at convincing customers to
be interested in a product
that it blows you away that it blows you
away i've seen one of those markers
today and his name is pobelter with his
stunning ad read for nickelodeon's new
show please check it out verbatim i
won't even commentate dwarp premieres
january 20th with new episodes every
thursday on nickelodeon milo the beloved
head geek at a popular strip mall comic
book shop finds his microcosm disrupted
when the boss hires a new employee the
quirky and excitable ruby this show is
wacky and fun don't mention other
networks or competitive ip example this
new series warped premieres jen
bravo the passion oh my god i have to
watch the show the way he delivered this
ad read made me feel like i was there
watching it with him wacky and fun when
he said that i [ __ ] screamed verbatim
reading the line don't mention
competitors like disney is so funny oh
what's funny is you still got paid easy
clap almost always with these situations
i know because i've worked with ludwig
even if he completely [ __ ] it up forget
something doesn't do it they probably
don't work with you again
but they don't want the the hassle of
like not paying because then they might
get dunked on social so they always pay
so you know they're probably not going
to hire a pub elter for round two
although i think they should

The Biggest Buyout in Gaming History - YouTube
welcome to marketing monday on january
18th that means yes it is a tuesday
marketing monday on a tuesday not
necessarily an uncommon thing lately but
we have big news today emergency
marketing monday microsoft just
purchased activision blizzard for a
whopping 68.7
billion dollars
absurd amount of money in the gaming
space it is by far the largest
acquisition in gaming history in fact i
have created a little chart to explain
it to you these are the activisions this
is the largest uh these are largest uh
acquisitions this is oculus for about
two billion
minecraft remember that erwin might
remember microsoft buying minecraft for
two and a half billion dollars was a
crazy big deal
in case you're wondering this one is
bigger than all of these combined it is
also not just one of the biggest gaming
extras of all time but it's actually the
biggest cash acquisition of the 2020s so
i made a tweet today that i would like
to share with you just a casual 70
billion all cash deal there are only
like four companies on earth that have
that much cash on hand people thought i
was exaggerating this is not the case
this is not an exaggeration the reason i
didn't think this was possible i didn't
i didn't predict this i want you guys to
know this was not
this was not on my 2022 bingo card i've
been thinking about production for 2022
i had no this was not a mirror because
70 billion dollars on an acquisition is
unprecedented uh if you look this is
companies bait raped on how much cash
they have on hand apple has 190 billion
dollars in cash on hand google has 170
billion microsoft has 140 billion they
spend about half just now on on this
amazon is 86 and that's it these are the
four companies that have enough cash on
hand to all cash buy out activision
blizzard and yes you heard it right
that's only half of the amount of money
that microsoft is sitting on so they
have plenty of money left over if they
wanted to buy something else and i also
said this line for reference it's over
half the value of sony as a company
that's also not a joke so let me show
you this this is what we showed okay
now let's rescale this chart with the
value of sony as a company
and remember i said microsoft only spent
half so they have in cash just sitting
around in cash the value of sony this is
the entire value of sony now i want to
show you one more thing let me show you
the value of microsoft as a company
you'll notice
you can't even see anything else this
gigantic 60 billion dollar activision
buyout is this now
sony is this now and this is microsoft
we're really talking about in technology
four or five companies that have
absolutely absurd amounts of power and
they're using their dominant control of
one industry and they're using that that
muscle they get from owning one industry
to uh buy out or dominate others and it
creates a very uh interesting
competitive landscape okay because it
creates a very daunting task for anyone
to go up against
let's let's talk about why let's talk
about why they did it number one
blizzard was historically cheap
basically as the stock began to free
fall in october november they began the
discussions of this bio it's actually a
very quick turnaround on this buy out
and if you're interested in investing in
activision blizzard stock because it's
free money before 90 a share perhaps you
should take a look at public a new kind
of brokerage this is an investing app
that has a couple key features that i
want to tell you about that i'm pretty
excited about here's an app review where
it gets a 9 out of 10. a couple things
that i thought were cool about it number
one it has fractional investing which
means if you want to invest in amazon
and don't have 3 178
you can put in 100 bucks and you get a
fraction of a share and if amazon goes
up 10 your fraction of a share goes up
10
if you sign up
using my link in the panel below and
check it out you also can get a free
stock up to 300 in value that means
right now if you were to click the
public link below download the app sign
up real quick you get a free share of
something it also has a social feed
where you can follow people's accounts
and any of their public trades you want
to follow you can find my account and
you can follow my trades so check it out
public it's in the link below uh get
your free stock check it out now let me
give you a story from my past that sort
of explains what i think happened here
with uh with this man this guy is like a
what's an animal that like is kind of
sleazy
but
i guess cunning went back into a corner
like a weasel or a rat
[Laughter]
let me try to explain this guy's
business style because it's not good
leadership and it's not smart and it's
it wasn't good for the company overall
but he does find ways to get paid so
first example was the overwatch league
there's a smaller scale but it's going
to explain he was a major major major
believer he was a major believer that
professionalized uh team-based
region-based esports were going to be
the future of blizzard it's something
they majorly invested in and they
convinced all these big sports owners to
invest 60 million dollars to buy an
overwatch league team et cetera and then
okay before the first season of
overwatch league launched he came to
twitch bobby kodek and the blizzard team
and they said hey you need to pay us
a hundred million dollars to get the
rights for overwatch league to stream on
twitch this i remember i remember this
very vividly and this was the first time
in my life where i realized that just
because people are
older and more successful than me in the
world of business does not mean they are
smart
it really it's a very clear moment to me
because it was so obvious to me like
what they were what who had the power
here the power was with twitch
this guy had just promised all of these
investors that the overwatch league was
gonna be a success from minute one it
was gonna come out the gates swinging
get huge viewership but unfortunately
the leadership at twitch and this sort
of frustrated me at the time seemed to
think oh yeah we should pay this
we should get a hundred million dollars
and pay blizzard for these rights
so twitch was like okay how do we make
this money back and it was things like
this okay watching overwatch on twitch
just got a lot more rewarding
you could get custom cheer modes
of all the teams
people are gonna have to spend
millions more bits on their aces high
london spitfire cheer modes only it
turns out people don't spend money
watching esports events they don't
subscribe they'll give their money to
xqc but they're not going to give their
money to the league but all of twitch's
projections were like yeah this is how
we're going to make our 100 million
dollars back
now that being said
my understanding is that bobby kodek
being the weasel that he is figured out
how to get this money and he basically
said we're gonna pull all blizzard games
from twitch now again this is this is
hearsay i i'm not in any of these
meetings i didn't know this is this is
me
now again would you have actually done
it i think zero percent chance it would
have been terrible for the company
there's no way he actually does it but
again twitch caved twitch cave and i
remember thinking was really stupid now
they get the hundred million dollars
twitch makes no money back almost no
money back it's a big disaster okay but
the two-year contract expires okay and
twitch is twitch has been burned and so
they come back and like all right twitch
let's do another round of this contract
and twitch is like
twitch is like no we're not doing
another hondo millie
and somehow
this man despite consistently lower
viewership every year
manages to get another big deal with
youtube this is again i don't know how
bobby kodak finds these deals
but out of nowhere he gets it he
offloads a product that again
should have almost no buyers to youtube
they lose all of the viewers of course
because it's on youtube now it goes down
like one-third or one tenth
flash forward to late last year blizzard
is in a bad way okay
none of their their saved your games
diablo 4 overwatch 2 or anywhere close
to ready
uh fans absolutely despise the massive
sexual uh assault and misconduct
allegations company
openly uh asking for his resignation
like the people of the company openly
asked for decision and if you guys
remember a few months ago the activision
blizzard board of directors was
supporting him they were like no no no
we believe in bobby kotec
and i remember thinking it's so weird
it's so weird they're not um they're not
ousting him because he's kind of getting
away the money and i've uh it now makes
perfect sense why they were behind him
because he was orchestrating a deal to
get them out of all of these problems
and dump it in microsoft's lap
and so
today
it is announced that all of the
leadership all of the owners of uh of
activision blizzard can get a nice
paycheck exit because again this is
where the stock was and instead the
purchase price that microsoft's buying
at is around here it's actually higher
than this it's about 90
90 a share so instead of going down here
they get to all exit right around here
bobby codec gets to make a big payday
and leave again
this is the amount he stands to make
i don't know if you can read this 300
million dollars if he leaves activision
business blizzard following a change of
control so look at his smile look at
that man
so rather than continue to write it down
or get forced out of their company they
just sold got got a last-ditch major
payout and they dumped it on microsoft
uh and there's there's a few key reasons
microsoft wants this company okay number
one uh the price is right so this is a
good time to buy in number two they want
access to the great ip okay there's
there's starcraft there's warcraft
there's all of the things that king had
all the mobile games number three of
course game pass their major strategy
and we've mentioned this in previous
console wars video
microsoft is a
when it comes to gaming is a game pass
first company their biggest plan is to
become the netflix of gaming and to make
buying a gameplay subscription a
no-brainer and the plan is to run
everyone else out of business become the
dominant platform for for subscription
games and then uh then you can race
prices to whatever whatever makes sense
so let me let me sort of sum up a little
bit of what my my my two minds are on
this
number one the good parts of this is
that it's good for blizzard okay the
leadership of blizzard is terrible they
[ __ ] up again and again and again and
there's great games that could come out
of blizzard on a larger scale
i am very deeply afraid of monopolies
and i'm very worried that gaming which
has been a very competitive space as we
trend towards consolidation
with big companies buying up more and
more of the market
that's scary that's where things go
wrong steam save us steve steve steve's
a monopoly of its own bro
so so so yeah and again that's steve is
actually a good example because what
platforms want to do at the beginning is
do anything possible to get people on
the platform and then once you have
enough then you have the scale to start
blowing people around in the early days
of steam they have to beg to get you on
the platform but once they're so big
that everyone uses it then you have to
beg them to be on there and give them
great deals so pretty soon
you know if xbox game basket is big
enough developers have to spend like
they're gonna have to give a huge cut to
xboxes to be on the game pass the fourth
reason the fourth reason is the
quote-unquote metaverse i'm gonna talk
about this in my next marketing monday
but here's a simple thing
if you hear the word metaverse in the
next year
just think video game
because it turns out after all of the
talk about metaverse from all these
different subjects
metaverse has essentially become
the uh adult investor word for video
games
and so as microsoft thinks about the
future of the metaverse essentially they
just want to build large connected
gaming worlds and then the fifth reason
final reason is mobile and it's also
kind of part of their metaverse plan but
they uh don't have great mobile games
and activation blizzard does they own
king they own candy crush on a bunch of
other games before i say what sony's
gonna do i'm telling you what the
government's gonna do so this is the
next slide that's really important
you might notice it's blank
uh because based on past trends we will
not be enforcing any anti-trust
regulation
uh they'll probably rubber stamp this so
i think monopolies are as american as
apple pie
yeah i think this will go through the
government's not gonna stop it now that
being said could they do another one
after this no and that answers one more
question people asked a lot because
people don't necessarily follow this
stuff why doesn't microsoft just buy
sony that has no chance of happening
there is no world where microsoft is
able to buy sony they have the money
sure they can't do it the money's not
the problem governments would block it
that is literally anti-competitive
monopoly directly it would reduce two
players to one that being said there are
a lot of companies that are still on the
table so i put together this how does
sony bounce back well let me tell you
when industries enter periods of
consolidation like this it becomes a big
race to buy up every available asset
these are the big ones that are on the
table i'm going to show you i'm going to
move my face you can see bandai namco
these are the largest remaining targets
all of these
are smaller than activision blizzard
which means they are all financially on
the table if i don't make a prediction
right now it's very likely that multiple
of these names but at least one
uh is announced to be uh uh acquired by
sony now the second thing they have to
do
is this announce their competitor to
xbox game pass now they've been secretly
working on it and it's been called
project spartacus
and i found out what it looked like by
googling the word spartacus this is my
best guess as to what project spartacus
will look like
to try and take down uh xbox game pass
and this will be announced i think
relatively soon
bezos buy me a house he's not do you
think he's in chat because he is
basil everyone say out of jeff bezos
actually we could even say goodbye to
some of the ceos that have tuned in
to you know figure out their next few
years of plans
bye ceos bye elon musk
bye thanks for watching marketing monday
hope you get your plans for gaming
The Biggest One-Day Drop in Stock History - YouTube
let's talk about something else i want
to talk about um facebook actually is it
so out of the blue but i want to talk
about facebook because god damn look at
facebook stock yesterday
[ __ ] crater dude what happened i'm
gonna explain it
you guys know apple's been talking up
privacy for a while now apple did a
whole
privacy push they had ads about privacy
and how they're more big up privacy and
wow you know privacy is their big thing
and then they released that the change
that made tracking opt in
rather than opt out and that
that has real it's with a lot of
businesses that relied on uh ad tracking
to make their money but that has [ __ ]
mark zuckerberg
[Laughter]
and what's really funny
uh i hope i got a picture um
bro i saved this but i saved too many
things so i might not have it give me
literally 45 seconds all right
how should someone get into stocks what
i recommend is going to wall street bets
sorting by controversial borrowing as
much money as you can and going all in
on the first thing you see just really
like pump it up and and risk high risk
the higher the risk the better if you
have a
mortgage kicking on your parents place
if you have a kidney you could sell
these are all
and then even if the whatever you buy
turns out to be stupid and it's
cratering just say huddle diamond hands
just say apes together strong
this is how you get into stocks i hope
that helps
do companies actually literally lose
money when their stock value goes down
it's a good question no but having a
high stock value
generally makes it easier to raise money
to take on debt at favorable terms
and the momentum having a rising stock
price also attracts talent for cheaper
because if you're trying to get like a
top engineer or something you can give
them a stock package that they're happy
to take because they know it's going to
go up
if you have to pay them raw salary it
becomes very expensive
so having your stock go up has a lot of
positive snowball effects
that are one of the reasons that um
we asked a winner take all economy
anyway that's about meta let's talk
about meta
facebook's in some real
[ __ ] trouble re i mean of the big
four so there's four big companies that
sort of come to dominate our entire
economy apple amazon facebook and google
facebook now meta those companies and
you could say microsoft as well actually
between those five companies they
basically have no industry they haven't
sort of thought about acquiring or
taking over
but the weakest one the weakest one of
the herd is proving to be this guys
because a lot of bad things are
happening for them all at once recently
number one
it's called
arpu average revenue per user the high
basically the high net worth high spend
users
they are all completely churned off of
facebook okay they don't use facebook
anymore facebook's completely gone for
them
the youth doesn't use facebook
advertisers generally are looking for a
high high net worth or uh the youth
that's like the two targets that
advertisers must look for facebook is
losing both
they
they are they are hated by most people
they have a terrible brand like their
brand is sort of in the dumpster and
they have a hard time making massive
acquisitions
because they've already bought you know
instagram whatsapp whatever
they bought a lot of things so the
government is um
if if there's any company that's being
focused on for antitrust to block
acquisitions it's facebook facebook and
google are the most in the headlights of
uh the government so they can't make
like 70 billion dollar buyouts like
microsoft can so that's that's problem
number two okay number three
nobody really wants to work there unless
they get paid exorbitantly nobody's
dream is working at facebook right now
it's like their top talent wants to work
elsewhere they have to pay them a lot of
money to work there because their brand
is bad so they're they're losing like
innovative founders that want to build
with the company
um number four this is most important
for their [ __ ] massive drop this is
the big this is the big [ __ ] dip the
crash this is primarily because of apple
apple sort of sent them a giant [ __ ] you
and changed opt-in to opt out i'm sorry
opt-out to opt-in and so now facebook
can't track data on ios and apple still
can apple's advertising business is
growing like crazy
it's funny that apple made this whole
thing about privacy and like it's all
about privacy but they just created
their own ad business which is blowing
up growing like crazy
and they're using all the data
themselves but they've blocked facebook
out so tim cook just sort of kicked
zuckerberg in the nuts i mean it's a
massive power play again these four
companies are so big
five companies basically that only they
can really compete with each other
smaller companies have a hard time
putting in dent in them but if apple
turns its warship on facebook that can
do real damage and they did so uh the
inability to track is leading to a
massive drop in the amount of
advertisers wanting to spend on facebook
uh with all that combined it's it's a
bad it's a dire situation and on top of
that they sort of have seen this coming
and they've been flat for a while
they've been seeing this coming
and they made this massive pivot to the
metaverse
and
if we're being honest is is a buzzword
right now it's a joke
it doesn't exist nobody's using a vr
headset to go talk to their their boys
the average person is not doing that so
this thing if the metaverse is real at
all it's 10 plus years out
so facebook is looking at a very
disgustingly bad next 10 years where
they just sort of slide so facebook
realized that their core business is
starting to slide
uh tick tock is absolutely eating their
lunch because the very people they want
to attract which are again high revenue
and the young are going to tick-tock
hand over fists creators are going to
tic toc not facebook reels is basically
like where tick tock's [ __ ] castaway
content lives so
it's it's all bad over it over at
facebook and that's why they dropped i
think i think it's the largest i think
it is a historic drop facebook lost
230 billion dollars of value in an
instant
[Laughter]
230 billion dollars less valuable in one
day what triggered that well i've been
talking about it for 30 minutes
uh yeah i want to talk about that
because i thought it was really
fascinating i thought it was pretty
fascinating they're sort of getting
owned here

I Ranked Every Super Bowl Ad 2022... - YouTube
welcome to marketing monday super bowl
edition the biggest day of the year in
the world of marketing it is the one day
of the entire year where the average
person cares about watching ads 99
percent of the time i try to talk about
talk about ads with people and they
don't give a [ __ ] but on super bowl day
everyone tunes in everyone cares and
everyone's got an opinion and i want to
hear them all so we are going to watch
every single ad top to bottom from this
last year's super bowl couple unique
things about this year's super bowl
number one most expensive super bowl
ever to purchase an ad and i'm talking
about ever that goes through uh 2020
where it peaked at 5.6 million dollars
for a 30-second super bowl spot this
year well over that closer to 7 million
maybe six point five to seven based on
how early you bought it seven million
all-time high for 30 seconds so every
time you watch a ad that's a minute long
know that it costs about 14 million
just for the slot let alone what it
costs to create these are very very
expensive and again you only get 30
seconds for 7 million dollars so you
really got to make it count and most of
them didn't
one of the big stories of all the ads
we're gonna see today is there was a lot
a lot a lot of crypto you could consider
it a coming out year for crypto i mean
it was a very celebrity focused and a
very crypto focused super bowl now again
i'm using the patented system that i
developed last year to accurately rank
all ads actually great for ads that were
actually pretty great pretty solid for
any ad that was like okay that was
pretty solid mediocre this is almost
every ad that you'll see in your entire
life which basically means ignored then
we have the seats here for cringe and
then finally we have the what the [ __ ]
tier where was like wow what the [ __ ]
were they thinking this is a true waste
of money and that's that so i want to
show you a tweet before we jump into our
very first uh ad to watch and that of
course comes from the hoster himself
connor eats pants who said i will buy
any product zendaya wants to sell me
and so we'll start with the squarespace
ad featuring zendaya
sally sold seashells
by the seashore but her seashells didn't
sell so well so sally set up a seashell
store on squarespace
soon her seashells started selling
suddenly sally was a seaside sensation
so much so she also sold swanky seashell
accessories
shiny seashell sequin skirts and sarongs
and seashell excursions of the seashore
to sum it up sally's seashells were so
successful she sailed into the setting
sun
as a seashell celebrity
[Music]
everything to shell anything squarespace
i saw a lot of uh i'll buy whatever the
seashell she's selling but they're not
selling seashells
listen i i almost shouldn't start this
one because i consider this i'm gonna
give you my my opinion uh i'm gonna give
it a uh pretty solid because as far as
celebrity endorsements goes first of all
they picked the best one right now
outside of maybe tom holland uh
zendaya's absolutely top of her game
right now literally like one of the most
loved people in america she's killing it
on like every different front whatever
they have that they have that um
likeability score i think it's like the
q score or whatever hers is probably
literally off the charts so excellent
celebrities also three stacks his voice
was great and they they feature the
product it wasn't featured heavily and
they did a little too much into the
seashell over and over and over and over
again without without tying it back to
the product but it was still pretty
clear in the story what happened that
she made a website she could sold more
stuff it makes sense the ad makes sense
it's clean it's beautifully presented
the uh celebrity's done well it doesn't
feel too cringe by the way keep this in
mind because this i think in my mind was
probably one of the best uses of
celebrities all super bowl and so
comparing them to this will show you how
how far they can fall next we got
avocados from mexico this is officially
the worst tailgate i've ever been to
look at those barbarians
hate it when they come to town i'm sorry
what are you doing adding avocados from
mexico
want some
let's kick this party up a notch
you know they also taste great on salads
yeah caesar we get it i love salad
avocados from mexico
a lot happened really quickly huh so the
concept of the ad is a coliseum tailgate
so all right 15 seconds to set up this
story which was punctuated with two bad
jokes then we get to the avocados from
mexico this part's fine they look tasty
awesome yeah man i i gotta give this bad
i feel like this your brain can't
process it it moves too much it's just
incredibly rushed i understand that
every second is hundreds of thousands of
dollars when you're buying seven million
dollars for an slot but i guess mediocre
it's very forgettable it's not not
particularly bad it's not egregious you
could have cut it down to one of those
jokes and then the rest of it be like
avocado they are banned from the u.s
they can't be right why would they
advertise the super bowl they're banned
from the u.s it happened after they paid
for the ad slot wait let's check
avocados from mexico banned
[Laughter]
wait they really did well you're
actually not wrong right after after
they paid for the ad
i want to waste the money they paid for
that ad and then right before it airs
all mexican avocado imports are banned
that is that is a bummer i'm sorry he
can't even get him bro that's about it
you can't even get him
next up we got
mcdonald's 30 second spot welcome to
mcdonald's may i take your order hi can
i get a
[Music]
can i get a
[Music]
go
[Music]
[Applause]
hey can i get a
10-piece chicken mcnuggets and what
sauce would you like with that
built for the memes featuring kanye
which i don't know if they knew he'd be
in the news so much uh actually pretty
good i'm gonna say it i mcdonald's
usually has a pretty good idea of what
works right now i think their agency
knew this would be memeable
good for social talkable it's it's kind
of like it's like the was up ad back in
the day i think it's clever i think it's
me when people want to repeat it it's
not you know earth-shattering
mind-breaking but i think it's pretty
good i think it's pretty clever i think
it's pretty smart i think as far as ads
go it's definitely up there i'm gonna
put it easily in the uh pretty solitaire
and i have no qualms about it okay next
up more celebrities for bmw it's a full
minute this is a 14 million dollar ad
just to buy the slot and this might be
the one one of the most expensive ads
that i've seen in the whole
super bowl my fellow gods the dark skies
have spoken it is time for susan i to
retire but where will you go
zeus
sorry luce i need a charge in this oh
thanks
sweetie
it's
i figure you could use a little picnia
all electric all electric
the bmw ix
bmw the ultimate electric driving
machine
someone said f not true to the character
of zeus zeus he didn't cheat on hera in
this ad
yeah he didn't i don't it would have
been a little odd right to include a
scene in the middle of a one-minute ad
where zeus cheats on his wife yeah i
mean this that was very expensive they
got two big time celebrities they made
the car look good i i don't know i think
it's pretty mid but i also know that it
was more memorable than the average bear
it was tough for me to say i think it'd
be higher of the of the mid tier all
they're really trying to get across is
that you know bmw's got an electric
vehicle and i think they do that i think
it's actually i might even put it in
pretty solvent being dead honest with
you they picked a very likable celebrity
which is half the battle i know
there's nothing no probably makes you
cringe or be offensive they got the
message across this is one of the ads
that sticks with you you probably don't
forget that you saw it moving on next up
we got oh this one was interesting i got
interesting take on this one let's go uh
barbie really wants this dream house
it's got stunning views and a slide
barbie's ready for fun so cool and
barbie found out about this dream house
with an alert from rocket homes
she did well it's a super competitive
market everyone wants to buy the dream
house better off a betty i'll go 10 over
asking cash over carl street cash you
vultures you're gonna start a bidding
war this is less than ideal oh no
don't worry barbie has a verified
approval that shows her finances are
backed by rocket mortgage so barbie wins
but we need a house oh i found a
fixer-upper castle on rocket homes
[Music]
i like his vibe get your dream house all
in one place with rocket homes and
rocket mortgage in my mind
pretty good not not insanely funny
nothing like that but uh it it this is a
real problem right now and it's hitting
the exact like literally perfect on the
demo of who they're trying to hit that
are all buying hounds right now this is
everything mentioned in this ad is a
real massive problem happening right now
for people buying homes buying homes are
the craziest market it's ever been in
like the past 20 years these are real
frustrations rocket mortgage positions
them as real problems
offers them as the the one-stop easy
solution all without feeling too rushed
or fast-paced i think if you were in the
market for a mortgage you would think
rocket mortgage right now i think it'd
be a place you'd look this is not an ad
for gen z this is an ad particularly for
gen x that whole area of people that are
moving into prime house buying years and
are recounting a lot of trouble nailed
them as a solution showed their product
looking easy and fun and then had the
right nostalgia around it and then anna
kendrick was a good pitch woman so in my
mind i think this is an actually good ad
i think this is and and just to back me
up a little bit there was some user
scores you know there was like they had
a bunch of people take scores as they
were watching the um super bowl this was
the highest rated ad of the super bowl
among average watchers i think in my
mind i'm gonna have to give it uh top
tier i i think i think it's a memorable
clean ad that that really pitches their
product as a solution to a problem that
people are actually having i'm gonna
give it a uh i'm gonna give it the first
the first good ad i think they got their
money's worth uh okay okay now
uh i was gonna save this one but we're
here we're it's the next one on my list
i'm just gonna play it let's get to it
are you ready the meta quest two
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
stop playing please let's go
[Music]
i'll say
[Music]
nothing i could say sums up my reaction
doesn't add and the concept has had
better than this tweet everything you
loved everything you have will be taken
from you and there is nothing you can do
about it you will lose all of it
but with these goggles you can enjoy a
fake version of the world you remembered
probably while alone
we are meta
that is literally the concept for this
incredibly strange off-putting dark ad
what the [ __ ] were they thinking i swear
to god i don't know what is going on in
the marketing team at facebook their
brand is already so bad this ad was so
weird just like extremely depressing
torn from his friends everything goes to
[ __ ] and then he's propped up like stuck
forever in this space cafe but he can
like
escape to the digital world like it's
just sad for what um meta needs so when
people over on the concept of the
metaverse right now right now because
again they're about 10 years early uh i
think they need more than this i i i
gotta say outside of this awesome bark
at the end this is like a depressing ad
it feels like it played right into every
criticism the one and only larry david
really surprised people
[Music]
i call it the wheel
i don't think so what does it do
it rules yeah so does a bagel okay a
bagel you can eat
one of the worst ideas i've ever heard
brother david behold it's a fork i got
ten forks right here baby
huh am i right
hmm
what is it
a toilet my lord you expect this court
to do its business inside we're not
animals
we go outside like humans
it's coffee
it's new
that's awful edison can i be honest with
you
it
stinks your wife know what's going on
here she knows i go to work
you're wasting your time and it's sad
football music
[Music]
like i was saying it's ftx it's a safe
and easy way to get into crypto
yeah i don't think so
hey not bad hey i know we don't hey i
know crypto boo i know crypto bad i know
oh crypto oh no larry david crypto but
you know what you know i like this ad
because i i wish i thought of the
concept the concept's great by god the
concept's so good it's just a good idea
for an ad and so i i i have to give it
some credit i know uh i know we're not
big crypto heads but uh positioning your
uh your critics and your opponents as
people that um are kind of like stuck in
the past making it seem like history is
on your side i mean that's all a really
clever thing for a crypto company to do
first of all this is one of the first
ads so far that have felt very super
bully a lot of these ads have felt
pretty like random tuesday watching
modern family ads you know what i'm
saying they're not they have nothing
they felt like they were not worth the
multi-million dollar price point this
feels like a real it has a real story
and a through line and a pitch man and i
i was impressed i think it was as
impressive and i think if it wasn't
crypto more people would agree with me
now we're getting down to the ones i
wanted to talk about we could have saved
it for the very end but let's start with
probably the biggest story of the ads
and that is the coinbase ad
that's the full 60 second 14 million
dollar ad costing them tens of millions
more because everyone that signed up
they gave 15 in bitcoin couple things
went wrong number one their website went
down uh immediately despite driving
insane amount of traffic on the day they
didn't tell any story with the ad so
without there's no recall later you know
it's tough to pitch his idea and get it
approved and spend a lot of money to
show a bouncing qr code the fact they
did it made it stand out it stood out it
was one of the most talked about ads it
was one of the highest rated ads
coinbase installs jumped to number two
on the app store the night of so it was
it was demonstrably successful i think
it's a very good ad i think they did not
coordinate well with their tech team
because having the website go down
defeats a lot of the purpose but people
at parties were getting their phones out
scanning it talking about it again
you're competing with other amazing
commercials with huge budgets and big
celebrities it's hard to win by picking
a bigger celebrity and getting more
celebrities and getting more colorful
and more song and dance i have to give
it big props but still a very clever ad
very clever ad and and i think bold and
i think it i think it's one of those
memorable ads of the super bowl i think
if we get to next year a lot of these
will be forgotten this one probably
won't all right each right off the grid
this one was rated highly by users which
means i am not in the target market
because i thought it was terrible so i'm
gonna i'm gonna tell you up and up front
i thought it's really bad but user's
rate is really highly so i'm interested
if it was uh
uh they found me nice suits you guys
blend right in the world needs you back
i'm retired greg you know this people
have their money just sitting around
doing nothing that's bad they shouldn't
do that they're getting crushed by
inflation well i feel for him they're
taking financial advice from memes
i'll get my onesies
good to have you back old friend yeah
eyes on the road benny welcome to a new
chapter in investing e-trade now from
morgan stanley i yes of course i
remember the e-trade baby from when i
was a kid and i know that boomers like
the e-trade baby but like the whole
concept of e-trade seems so dated you
can you can trade online with anyone now
it's not
each rate is no longer a unique selling
point
it's on trending i don't know it was
just surprisingly highly rated so i
don't know i guess i'll give it higher
forgettable last year budweiser sat out
the super bowl they could not find a way
to make what they were doing appealing
in the environment of the last year's
super bowl they didn't know how to
tackle it this year they are back what
did they come back with for budweiser
one of the longest and most storied
super bowl brands what did they come
back with
by the way when i watch this live right
here ari asked who's this an ad for and
i said well i've seen a horse and a dog
so far so it's definitely budweiser
they have a type they have a type and
it's very distinct
horse
[Music]
[Laughter]
hell yeah brother god damn it nothing
more american than that
chills
literal chills ah it feels like one of
the most lazy budweiser ads i've ever
seen
they understand how to make you feel
stuff with animals that's been their
go-to this felt like they are completely
out of ideas
it was it was so
so basic it's a complete nothing burger
this is their big comeback head oh guy
fieri add bud light hard seltzer soda
featuring guy fieri bud light seltzer
hard suit by the way showed up to the
super bowl in the at and the outfit from
this ad you both like seltzer hard soda
classic cola
[Applause]
without flavor the mayor must see this
hey hey wait
where are we
flavor flavor flavor flavor flavor
blend
[Music]
there's a new flavor in town
i declare bud light seltzer hard soda
the loudest flavors ever
flavor
pretty solid pretty solid pretty soft
pretty good pretty good pretty fun guy
fieri has owned his image feels like
right up his alley and the concept of
literal flavor town is pretty funny not
really up to the marketers who made the
video or the ad pretty good package
design too i got the position i like the
whole thing uh oh here's a big teaser
this is definitely the most expensive
overall for what they're selling haven't
you ever wondered
what else is out there i wonder if you
started with this
[Music]
i think this is an interesting one
because i i want it to be good but i
want to tell you so ari is a really big
lord of the rings fan much bigger than
me and she saw this ad and she had been
really excited for the show and she said
this ad kind of killed her hype i i have
no strong take on it i wish this ad was
better because i would like to be
excited for this show the whole idea of
saying remember all this cool [ __ ] from
lord of the rings this is before that
that's a that's a weird opener to me i
don't think this did what they wanted
which is to get you like and i think for
the super bowl you want better than this
um lebron commercial
all right so cordless headphones and
y'all gotta let your cars
yeah the future is crunk futuristic
what's wrong lebron is the hype too much
am i ready
i can't tell you everything but if you
want to make history you got to call
your own shots
we're going to the league
i
hate
crypto.com's ad strategy this is the
same thing as the matt damon where he's
like and people went to the moon and
people sailed uncharted waters and you
can buy dogecoin
like it's not what the [ __ ] are you
talking about they're just doing
unrelated bold things
yeah it's just really pretentious but i
think this ad being for crypto just
feels odd oh yeah yeah yeah okay all
right final ad because you know what let
me tell you something you know what's
more important than marketing
nothing
but you know it's a close second
your fiance on valentine's day
so i'm gonna watch i'm gonna watch
doritos and then i'm gonna go spend time
with that fiance on valentine's day
so let's say all right here it is final
commercial of the night i hope it's a
winner
ah
[Music]
oh baby baby but baby baby
baby baby
yeah i saw this live and thought it was
pretty
mid to bad but
again i might be too i'm gonna be doing
too hotty here this is talking animals
making goofy sounds like people love
that [ __ ]
people it just it felt like even when
you do that you got to be a little more
clever than this and this wasn't i
thought the whole joke was that it would
just be the sloth and then he would eat
the chip and it would be like so spicy
that like he would go from slow but he
just sort of like everyone just starts
dancing i thought he would die you
thought he would die you know they'd
show a cute animal climbing down to the
forest floor to eat a dorito and then
instantly dies i'd be bold that'd be
coin based bowls
people would be talking about that
you might have seen a super bowl with
that anyway with that that is our review
all super bowl ads and this year i will
uh publish my tier list i'll i'll rank
them all from what we did today overall
though i'm gonna say overall ranking of
the year pretty mid a few standouts but
no iconic commercials this year
appreciate you watching hope you have a
great night and i'll see you when i see
[Music]
Explaining Inflation to Zoomers - YouTube
i actually do without my inflation
because inflation is kind of crazy bears
you know i'm gonna i'm kind of you know
what you can do you know
i i want to talk about sort of the the
situation we find ourselves in in uh
most of the countries that you guys live
in now okay here's the thing here's the
deal and this is why it's probably good
that we do this now when you hear the
words inflation or you hear something
like interest rates it's very easy for
your brain to be like this
i think a lot of times these terms are
designed and obfuscated in a way to make
it hard to focus
harder so i'm gonna try and keep it as
simple as possible but i also understand
that we need to open with a round of
let's just all say glizzy hands yep coke
let's just get all that fun stuff out of
the way
all right we good are we good
you might do you mind so
here's the deal
do any of you guys know you probably
don't maybe you do the investor
charlie munger
yes no yes no no no all right he's
warren buffett's business partner he's
one of the best investors in history
pretty old but he has one of the best
track records in history
he
dropped this
incredibly dire interview this is him on
the right okay really and the stock
market is is down a bit this year maybe
because of inflation i want to ask you
specifically about inflation are we
looking at a prolonged decline
in the markets because of inflation is
inflation on the rise and should we be
concerned about it
well let me take that in the reverse
order inflation is a very serious
subject you can argue it's the way
democracies die when democracy dies in
latin america inflation is a big part of
it so it's a huge danger
once you've got a populist that learns
it can vote itself money listen to that
phrase though listen there's a lot of
knowledge in this guy i know he's he's
like a walking corpse i get it
but let's plot some of the things he's
saying number one this is how
democracies die number two
once a population learns they can vote
themselves money okay that is key we're
gonna say let's finish off this thing
though
if you look at the
roman republic even after they went to a
empire with an absolute ruler
they inflated the currency steadily for
hundreds of years and eventually the
whole damn roman empire
collapsed
and then this guy tries to get into
talking lighter news so the
interviewer's like wow that's that's
dark the collapse of society and so he
goes is it something investors need to
be worried about specifically when it
comes to growth stocks right now those
guys let's talk about [ __ ] zoom stock
dude it's like what are you talking
about hundreds of years of collapse i
want to talk about it [ __ ]
you know is facebook going up bro well i
think the safe assumption
for an investor is that over the next
100 years the
currency's going to zero
wow
[Laughter]
long paused in a while i love that
charlie munger at age 98
is thinking in 100 year timelines
this guy [ __ ] he wants to talk about
anything else he wants to talk about
anything else than charlie murray
telling him the world's gonna collapse
but uh okay look maybe he's a little too
doom and gloom but i wanna i wanna talk
about what he said here real quick which
is basically that rampant inflation is
one of the biggest causes of a societal
unrest because any savings that the
middle class has accumulated becomes
rapidly worthless so let's take a look
at this chart right here this chart
right here is the amount of money this
is about basically the amount of money
that the government's printing and then
right around the pandemic it spiked at a
level never before seen and now it's at
all time colossal crazy banana bears
high let me back up a little bit so when
the when the uh housing crisis 2007 when
the great financial crisis happened we
were set for a pretty big depression and
what stopped it what stopped it was the
government just printing a bunch of
money basically doing massive bailouts
flooding the market with with free money
and it worked
and unfortunate thing about that working
is that we haven't stopped that strategy
since and you know this happened slowly
over time but since the pandemic it's
been absolutely uh insane and so for
the first year of it it's like
everything's on crack and that's why we
got [ __ ] nfts to the moon dogecoin
going crazy housing prices skyrocketing
but the hangover effects of that
is that money starts to become less
valuable per dollar that's inflation and
so we're starting to get uh the highest
recorded inflation ever it's it's
happening like crazy uh now now i want
to explain real quick so i i want to
explain very simply basically when you
hear interest rates like the government
sets interest rates it's hard to figure
out what that means or what's going on
interest rates are based so imagine this
is the federal reserve it's just a big
pile of infinite money and the banks
borrow from this
and then loan the money out to you
basically interest rates are the cost of
borrowing money that's it and the
government can set it by how much what
they charge banks to borrow from them
and if you want to juice the economy a
little bit if things are rough let's say
we have a big housing crisis what you
can do is you can lower the interest
rate when interest rates are high like
if you have money sitting in a bank
you'll get you'll get a lot of money if
you're just sitting there but when
they're low and borrowing money is easy
then everyone starts borrowing money to
do things like start businesses and hire
employees and build factories and and so
it juices your economy the problem is
when interest rates are low
you can't just stash your money in a
bank and make money so you can see over
the past you know 30 years the
government has been continually lowering
interest rates to try and juice the
economy and then after 2008 they
basically dropped them to zero money is
essentially free to borrow so right
about now is when it's starting to get
because we did so much in the past year
interest rates were zero we printed a
[ __ ] ton of money and the dollar started
rewards left less and less and so you're
faced with two choices to get inflation
back under control they have to raise
interest rates and the second it becomes
more expensive to borrow companies start
collapsing companies that were like
basically shoddily run zombie companies
yeah our entire economy is basically
running on credit and and debt and so uh
every single administration knows that
it that there's a problem that inflation
is starting to get worse and worse and
worse but they also know that if they
are the ones to pull the plug on the
party their whole party loses that it's
basically hot potato and so they've been
passing this back and forth and just
every time they get in power they print
a bunch of money to make everybody happy
and do things so um the second someone
stops printing money they turn off the
spigot they stop buying the bad debt
they stop printing money they start
raising interest rates we're gonna have
a recession there's like no way around
it there's going to be a return if not a
depression the unfortunate thing for
biden specifically is that it looks like
it's finally happening it looks like the
chickens are coming to roost
and so
he's sort of getting hit with this
no-lose situation
which is where
they're in this real catch-22 where the
hot potatoes landed here and they can
either
raise interest rates collapse the
economy destroy people's pensions make a
real estate worth way less and so if you
tank it you will lose the election
guaranteed or you can print a bunch more
money to band-aid it
and keep inflation hot and kick it down
the road but uh the problem is that
won't work either because everyone's so
mad about inflation that it looks like
the democrats are about to get
absolutely sweeped in the midterms and
so what they're trying to do
is talk a big game about how hard
they're going to be on inflation while
actually not doing very much about it at
all because if they actually do anything
it's a collapse and on the other side of
it if you look at even more
zoomed out crazy lens
this is the
us national debt it's 30 trillion
dollars the payments on this debt are
now
one of the biggest parts of the yearly
government budget and one of the best
ways to make this debt not a problem
is to inflate the currency so much that
it's not worth as much so if you inflate
the currency enough your debt is
worthless
the actual what it's actually amount is
worthless and so
we're running into a situation where um
the only way the us can reasonably
afford
all of the debts that it owes
not just on the national debt but on
social security etc
is to make the amount they owe worth
less
so there's it's kind of a no-win that's
all starting to hit right now
do you think this will increase the
value of my shiba coin yes so that's the
end that's the whole point everything
i'm saying today is all to say that
shebacoin is the greatest investment
thank you for bringing that up yes this
whole discussion all goes back
to sheba coin which is what i was trying
to say
can we print more money so we already
are and we already are printing an
insane amount of money just to keep this
[ __ ] ship going but we'd have to
print some kind of absurd amount on top
of this and that would only further
cause the problem zoomers are the clutch
or kick generation
yeah bro
it's all on you guys i love that i love
that that's actually a good idea
how about us millennials anyone in chat
let's just do what the boomers did and
kick the can
the clock is running out we might barely
make it and we can punt it to them and
then they can clutch or kick
this is actually sounding really good i
think if we let jake paul president jake
paul fix it

The Marketing Reason Why Elden Ring Can't Add "Easy Mode" - YouTube
welcome to marketing monday on monday
march 7th let's talk about our topic so
what have i been obsessed with for the
past week out in the ring baby but not
in the way you think today's marketing
monday topic is a debate that's raging
all over the internet and i thought i'd
offer a unique perspective on it the
question today is why elden ring cannot
add an easy mode why the difficulty
choice has nothing to do with game
design and has everything to do with
branding but first a little bit of
background elton ring just dropped last
week to absolutely enormous critical
success one of the highest rated games
of all time a true instant classic uh
additionally it's been phenomenally
commercially successful it's not just a
indie darling
but it's been top of steam the largest
from soft launch ever truly truly a
phenomenally successful launch there's
no disputing that so let's go uh back in
time for a little bit back to 2009. now
some of you i guess were two years old
we can go to this ps3 title called demon
souls where a young miyazaki was a newly
hired uh coder at fromsoft entertainment
and he was assigned to the game demon
souls which was thought internally to be
uh doomed it had an uncompelling
prototype and no one else wanted to work
on it he wanted to work on it because he
figured if i could find a way to take
control of the game i could turn it into
anything i wanted so yep that's that and
i also want to mention uh one more thing
uh the sponsor of marketing monday who
has made all of this possible i wanna
shout out public.com there is a link in
the description below basically what
public is a stock trading app you can
invest in stocks crypto anything
anything basically investable so you can
find my account on there and follow me
if you want to see things that i'm
investing in or talking about but you
can also follow a lot of acclaimed
investors and follow their moves you
could follow for example kimball musk
and sell tesla when he did
and most importantly for me that makes
it stand out from its competition here
is that uh they do not sell your trade
information to market makers public does
not do that they make the money off of
unspent they just basically invest
unspent money thanks again to the public
uh check them out link description below
and so
because there was this one chance to try
things that were um
unproven ideas he was able to create
demon souls again 2009 as we say here is
the era of the we a lot of games were
doing the big open worlds maps filled
with different dots they were
hand-holding quite a bit and this went
the entire opposite direction and when
people played demos of it they hated it
but after release it began to get some
uh cult following people that played it
actually find themselves liking it that
means it was able to stand out um and it
paid off quite handsomely so if you look
this is the sales figures for all their
previous games middling to no success
they had adventures of cookies and cream
was their best game from fromsoft prior
to the release of demon souls which
barely edged it out from there they
gained a cult following and when they
released dark souls two years later it
actually was a massive success dark
souls 2 even better dark souls 3 huge
and then eldon ring
in the first week absolutely smashing
almost all these previous ones and on
pace to be bigger than all these by far
and on the contrary games that have
adopted more traditional methods of
being quote unquote triple a are in fact
struggling horizon forbidden west which
has the terrible distinction of
launching their first game around breath
of the wild and their second game around
elton ring
one of the worst launch schedules of all
time uh has had a massive drop in sales
following elton ring's launch 80
down there's a couple things i want to
talk about today the main questions
about difficulty because i think that's
the most interesting aspect of their
brand and the one that's being debated
most often but a couple things i want to
mention before that is is the unique
aspect they did with not hand holding
with regards to the map and quest npcs
and all that so this is an example of l
rings map as you can see it's extremely
sparse
there is not much on this map it looks
very weathered looks very old world only
extremely functional things a lot of
emptiness in between there's a lot of
stuff on this map but you don't see it
on their map and in comparison i pulled
a screenshot of horizon zero dawns men
this is horizon forbidden for ridden
west map this is the map this game came
out the same time it has an entirely
different approach to the concept of
open world but it can be said that this
is this is more um overwhelming more
confusing
and more importantly is it scratches an
entirely different itch so what i think
a lot of aaa games have leaned into is
almost skinner boxy and methods of
getting humans addicted and humans love
task completion but at some point it's
refreshing and it's it's it definitely
when a game actually refuses to do that
and cuts it all back it's also freeing
the branding choices that it's made to
be distinct are powerful so moving on uh
this made some developers angry and
these are developers from ubisoft and
gorilla and some other sony studios
basically kind of mad at the elden ring
reviews my life is a lie they also don't
care about pc graphics stability and
performance apparently nor quest design
really and you know coming from users
this would be just an opinion but coming
from developers it reads like sour
grapes it reads like not understanding
that there may be something distinct
here that is refreshing to gamers that
is causing a unique brand to emerge and
so um this kind of summed it up for me
daniel dwyer had a great as nasty as the
is elden ring designed well discourse is
maybe a thing worth considering is why
many players are so forgiving of rough
edges odd ux and idiosyncratic design
perhaps there are valuable lessons there
and i think there are i think that there
are are things that other developers can
learn from and even improve on i don't
think anyone who is serious about it
will say that the ui i don't think any
aspect of elden ring is quote unquote
perfect as it can never be improved
what gamers think are responding to and
what a good brand will build their brand
on is being distinct uh and the ones
that come up for fromsoft are unique and
examples of some of the ways ubisoft has
been uh you know sort of counter-branded
on this receiving actually most of the
flak from the gaming community
is there's a lot of ubisoft related
memes because they have the biggest
brand of having the most boring skinner
boxy in open world games if eldon ring
was an ubisoft game you would have paid
real money in their store to get the
stone sword key whether or not that's
true or not it feels true because
ubisoft has over time built a very poor
brand
around how they design their open world
games and this would not ring true for
fromsoft because they've built a
distinct brand they've held true to
their what are their core principles are
whether or not they're right that being
said
the demand is still there gamers are
gamers the fact that they choose not to
do it does not mean that they couldn't
do it you know what i'm saying elden
ring runes are for sale on ebay right
now
and they could tap into it and they
choose not to it's what i'm saying they
are choosing to avoid
making the money because the brand gain
is probably worth it for them in the
long run over the short-term gain uh
that ubisoft might take from selling
items this also was a great example
someone said if ubisoft designed the ui
again this is hyperbole but this is what
the brand has caused gamers to think and
so i found a study on this i found this
with regards to tesla
because tesla had i wanted to sort of
talk about why i don't think couple ui
issues and i think eldon ring has a
couple ui issues but gamers can forgive
that because it's distinct and i want to
get into that with brand image so this
is a research done on tesla and it was
why tesla who had some serious quality
control issues they were releasing cars
that had like missing rivets doors that
weren't hinged properly and they were
turning out that that stuff wasn't
affecting consumer perception it wasn't
hurting their brand what this study
found was that low brand image is much
more damaging than low brand quality and
they do things differently they have
different showrooms their shows look
like much more higher quality they don't
do tv advertising there's no like guy in
a cowboy hat going like a truck but kind
of thing for summertime they stand out
and that has caused them to have die
hard rabid fans it's similar to what
fromsoft has done with their games and i
think brands like ubisoft may not
understand that now we're talking about
difficulty difficulty is one of the core
core parts of the fromsoft brand it's
what allowed them to really stand out
from the pack for a while until maybe
elden ring which has sort of branched
that it was their main thing and they've
leaned into it i mean they have the
prepare to die edition they've had ads
for dark souls 2 that basically said how
difficult it was they've leaned into it
it's been part of their ethos
dark souls has been shorthand in the
gaming community for difficulty for
years now people call things the dark
souls of x
and so what i want to do is compare that
across in the marketing world and to do
that i decided to mix the two
by showing you godric the grafted in a
gucci belt and bucket cap and this will
make sense
in a second uh when i think of the what
what benefits difficulty gives um a game
like ellen ring or any from game what
are the benefits for for the for the
community like what does the user get
the difficulty because when you think
about it here's the real question right
the main question people phrase it as is
is why wouldn't you just add like who
does it hurt like you don't have to use
it and you think about that and i'm like
okay on surface level that seems fine
there are two things one
is communal shared experience so it
being difficult and being the same for
every single person that plays it that
means if you and i both beat it you know
that we accomplish the same thing
there's a there's a shared bond it's a
rite of passage in a way and it's also
like the entire community when the game
releases is is conquering the challenges
together we are all going at different
paces on the same journey we have we
have fewer and fewer shared communal
experiences in this world everything is
getting more and more micro news people
don't watch the same shows anymore
people don't watch the consumer same
media so when a big thing comes out that
we can all sort of uh participate in
together it feels like you're part of
something and number two is and this is
what they talk about in their design
philosophy is that challenging provides
reward the fact that you overcame the
challenge makes it that much more
rewarding when you do and i think i'm
the perfect example of that because i
spent seven hours in the tree sentinel
and had the best moment of my life i
freaking it was better than sex when i
beat that thing
and adding an easy mode can really
undercut that because we're not all that
mentally strong for a lot of people
getting stuck on a frustrating boss they
wouldn't be strong enough to stop
themselves from creating the difficulty
down you know what i'm saying it would
be very easy for them to be like in a
moment of weakness make the game easy so
those are two things the third thing and
this is the one i'm talking about later
but i think is the the downside you know
this is this is something that they
benefit from brand wise but isn't
probably a great thing
it's that for people i want to be
careful here
for people who may not have a lot of
other things they are accomplished or or
proud about it can almost be like um
extremely important to them in that way
do you know what i'm saying
in a world where it's hard to make
progress on things and accomplish things
which is true real world is very
difficult having something that is
universally recognized as difficult can
give them
a sense of superiority or satisfaction
that other games cannot and this is
probably the dark side of it this is
probably the downside but this
perception difficulty allows them that
feeling of accomplishment
a feeling of real pride and
accomplishment in a way that uh ea could
never match but i think this is a huge
part of some of the core rabid fans that
have built the enduring brand of dark
souls and i think to remove that
capability would remove these fans and
remove their ability to help spread this
message forward wide and help get this
game so popular and so that's why i want
to go back to this gucci belt and i want
to talk about why the difficulty creates
a sense of scarcity so for example if
you look at the steam charts so if i
were to pull up
the steam achievements for a game like
sekiro you might notice
only
17 of people who bought the game have
even beaten ishin the final boss so the
game sold millions of copies but most of
those millions never beat the game what
that creates with a sense of difficulty
is scarcity and as we've talked about in
previous marketing mondays scarcity is
probably one of the number one ways in
the world in all of branding to create
brand value
and so uh bringing back to the closed
example i i thought of this fashion
brands will literally destroy billions
of their own merchandise to keep it
scarce they don't sell it for cheaper
they don't discount it they destroy it
because if it were to be sold for
clearance or for cheap over time that
would make it less scarce and reduce the
brand value of their product it's
basically what fromsoft is doing by
making less people able to beat it it
feels more accomplishing for those that
do now the downside of that is this as
the game has gotten more accessible and
there's no denying that elder ring is
the most
accessible of the game so far it's
actually added many many ways that make
it kind of a lot easier to beat fromsoft
fans still need that scarcity so much
like these guys destroying their own
products fromsoft fans are destroying
players of their own game by getting mad
at them for using summons or magic
because they need to reduce the amount
of people that that qualify as real fans
this is an actual psychological need
because the scarcity is being reduced so
they need to gatekeep they need to burn
the excess product i killed the story
boss yesterday and the achievements said
that twenty two five percent players
killed him he wasn't even hard and i
died a couple of times just don't play
the game if you cry about design and
difficulty you know what i'm saying you
know they're they're right to be proud
when they beat it but often their pride
is only defined by how many people fail
um this this example really
this pissed me off
no magic summons just katanas only this
boss was super easy for me because it's
fast paced but for average low iq elden
ring players who have negative reaction
speeds it will be a filter
and then
they followed up by replying to their
own tweet and finding someone else who
wasn't talking to them who said that
boss was hard i beat him on my second
try because he's actually a soul's boss
this is not an isolated incident this is
almost the core of
what has
given these things um
added value so while i think we should
call this all out as cringe i want you
to understand that this is a bigger more
widespread phenomenon and and it's it's
it's not just exclusive to gamers and so
i want to talk about uh what is called
the brand identity model and this is
sort of a good way to um think about
what what things are are core and
essential to a brand you can use this
for almost any brand i've used this in
examples for nvidia uh it's sort of like
it's a it's a mental model that you used
to think about a way a brand is and you
try to find out the core where's the
nucleus what's the core thing that is
like the the bedrock of the brand then
key things that form your identity and
then things that are kind of potentially
related for from software i think the
brand essence is that it's challenging i
think when you think about what is their
core identity what if you if you if i
had to ask you for one word that summed
up all from software games i think it
would be difficult or challenging what
makes a core brightness the three things
that are required like to make sure this
passes that test it has to be these
three things it has to be differentiated
is it relevant does it matter to gamers
i think we've proven that it does
uh is it sustainable is it something you
can keep up over all your games of
course they've done it they've done it
for all their games so if it passes d3
test then it could be the core of your
brand essence and to confirm that i
decided to read a lot of interviews with
miyazaki himself and i found this quote
that really summed it up for me that it
tells me they understand it so he said
we're always looking to improve but in
our game specifically hardship is what
gives meaning to the experience
so it's not something we're willing to
abandon at the moment it is our identity
and i think when you think about that i
think they understand what's most
important in the world of branding is
identity and so shout outs to him for
for going left when i went right and
shout out to them for all the success
that is my presentation
i hope you enjoyed

The Worst Ad Read Ever - YouTube
speaking of learning and laughing let's
get to the wins and fails starting off
with a company taking home a rare
double trophy win and a fail same
company same week and that of course is
probably all my
gen alpha viewers favorite company of
all time roblox but first let me set the
stage now you guys know internet
businesses especially platforms like
like platform businesses like youtube
twitch facebook they've all used a
similar model and that is make sure the
old rich power people are looking the
other way and don't understand and then
steal everything they can you could post
anything you could post any copyrighted
music copyrighted uh video that they
look the other way it helps them scale
to the big size and then when they get
big
they're more likely to crack down on it
and they can use the power they have to
force the people that made the content
before to make stuff on their platform
so roblox has done the same thing okay
roblox
is full i'd say well over half of roblox
content is just stolen copyrighted
content but now roblox has gotten so big
and so powerful they can go back to
these companies they've been ripping off
and kind of make them pay
that's what they did now roblox is now
getting an official sonic the hedgehog
game backed by sega called sonic speed
simulator roblox gets a cut of this
there is no way sega wants to go to a
company that's been stealing sonic
assets for years and give them money but
they have to
they have to because roblox is that big
now the business model is paying off yet
again the platform business model of
steel until you're big enough
is working for roblox and this is just
the beginning they also
gotta fail because they all have to
start cracking down on some things
specifically
with this big piece of news hit roblox
this week when on an episode of the
kardashians
khloe will you look at this
what let me see this is a character on
roblox but it says
that i know that's why i said that's not
my character that's a game oh it's a
game
oh well then we're suing them if it's a
game with my name and picture
anyway yes so she said um
oh we're suing them and that would have
been an appropriate response even if it
was just her name and likeness but
actually the game was called kim
kardashian sex tape 2.
yeah so roblox obviously sensing a pr
disaster has banished that developer
they've scrubbed everything
they nuked everything they've ever done
and banned them but obviously this is
the beginning of a trend of people
starting to realize
how much roblox has gotten away with
this happened with youtube it happened
with twitch it's happening everywhere so
i think roblox has
edged those interaction but they are
they are not hitting the mainstream of
um of attention on lawsuits
um okay fail let's get let's get another
fail i want to give a fail to the to the
company that deserves to fail most of
all this past week can we get a
resounding [ __ ] you
from everyone to intuit turbo tax
big ass fail if you guys don't know this
past week was uh tax tax week tax day
uh a while ago our government sort of
realized that taxes were getting
increasingly complicated for people that
they didn't need to be
because the irs already knows for the
vast majority of americans how much they
owe in taxes it's already reported by
their employer the irs has a number in
mind
and so the government started to develop
a free
tax reporting software that would just
tell you how much you owe and you could
add any deductions you needed to add and
then submit it would be a
straightforward free seamless process
many countries already do this they were
the models that our government was
looking at
intuit realized that would cost them a
lot of money so they drastically ramped
up their lobbying spending and started
paying politicians and paying lobbyists
to slow this down or stop it and
eventually the compromise they agreed to
intuit turbo tax
would not be competed with by the
government they wouldn't make their own
free software as long as they would
agree to offer a free version to the
majority of americans okay but the thing
they did
is do everything possible to hide that
the free version exists in fact they
have multiple versions all of which are
advertised as quote unquote free but
often end in a charge they they have
paid
um seo people to remove everything on
the website that would that would
include it in a search engine so the
actual free version does not appear on
google no matter what and so i give the
fail to them there's this funny post
someone made this post uh clicking
random buttons on turbo tax with miley
cyrus looking
looking confused and wistful and forlorn
which i thought was a great tweet and
then turbotex responded and said
everybody makes mistakes everybody has
those days trying to be quote unquote
relatable cool for them i guess
and then uh he responded and said yeah
like when you tell everyone it's gonna
be free
so it's uh it's really lame but
thankfully thankfully you know what
times aren't so bad
because we can still own these brands on
twitter
so it's a win for us who cares if we
can't prosecute them we can't charge
them antitrust
we can't make any meaningful legal
progress on on changing the way they are
we can always ratio them dude yes
yes
uh speaking of getting ratioed on
twitter
uh i saw a i don't know if it's because
i'm starting to enter a new tax bracket
myself
i got some weird promoted tweets
there is apparently an organization
called the american property owners
alliance which is essentially rich
landlords and they spend money on
twitter ads to try and convince people
that uh you know we shouldn't build more
affordable housing we shouldn't have
rent control et cetera et cetera but one
of them got promoted to me that i
thought was extra funny
because it said
rt if you're a property manager
committed to protecting your investment
and your tenants hashtag owners and
neighbors and it got with paid
literally zero rt's
zero likes and this was promoted in my
feed like i was seeing this
and nobody
nobody saw it so i'm glad i see the
landlords are using their rent money
that they've gotten
uh appropriately and responsibly
world's easiest ratio
i just ratioed it
i just rationed it oh [ __ ]
whoa
feels good baby
that's all it takes to beat the
landlords back
that's a good segue because speaking of
not effective marketing it is a fail
on behalf of taco bell
and i suppose a win
on behalf of doja cat
this past week i saw
the worst
influencer campaign
of all time
dogia cat was required
to do a mexican pizza wrap for taco bell
which would have been cringe enough
before it went up she posted this on tik
tok
i gotta do this [ __ ] you gotta be
quiet though you can't tell anybody that
i told you this i gotta do this [ __ ]
tech talk
where i do like and everybody keeps
calling it a jingle
but i have to do a jingle they want me
to rap about mexican pizza so i just
want to give you a heads up before you
see that [ __ ]
just
know it's contractual
can you imagine being taco bell and
spending millions of dollars
to get her to do this
and getting your marketing team in
meetings with her team and like bouncing
ideas
and then paying and then she writes the
contract and then right before it goes
up she posts this
hi
i made a song about mexican pizza
because i love it so much i wish the
taco bell didn't discontinue it a year
ago
and uh this led me to this monstrosity
of a beat that i just made you can just
tell she's into it you can tell she's
really got the passion
[Music]
i got beans i need meat i need a shell
with the sauce and cheese give you hell
if you cross me
bout the throwhand to get one try me

give that some clear air dosha cat the
voice of the taco bell people was one of
the first to confirm the news this past
weekend when she literally dropped the
mic with hot news of the mexican pizza's
return this may
it'd be worse if you said that
um speaking of influencers let's talk
about dream who's had quite a couple
weeks i haven't even even has the
world's biggest dream fan i have been
able to follow all the drama
but i can tell you one thing i'll tell
you who has been following it the
official
tumblr account
[Laughter]
the official tumblr account was hanging
out in the [ __ ] dream
dream out
space twitter spaces
maybe chiming in
maybe making their own points uh or or
defending dream who knows
oh wait one more one more one more one
more
let's get that's another nice one it's
not a win okay i always like seeing good
pr in the wild there was a model
that got
caught on camera kissing timothy
chalamet at coachella and was asked
about it and uh she had this response
everyone is asking me if i was kissing
timothy chalamet coachella and that is a
good question for statement continues
but a great question would be asking why
are world leaders why the earth is now
losing 1.2 trillion tons of ice ice each
year due to global warming and why
climate crisis reform has been
completely ineffective
i encourage you to contact your local
representatives and ask them that
that is good
that is good because who wants to be the
idiot still talking about
celebrity gossip after that
as
extremely well played
and it's also effective activism yeah
it's it's a win-win
well played i think it's a perfect pair
it is a perfect parry
it is truly a perfect parry so i gave
that a win
i think that's all for my wins and fails

Elon Musk Buys Twitter - YouTube
elon musk has purchased twitter for 43
billion
dollars and we've got all of the takes
in the world about it in fact i think it
has created even faster take-ception
than the will smith incident which i
thought was impossible every single
person on twitter has posted every
single variant of every possible take
good and bad already everything i'm
saying cannot be new because every
possible opinion has already been taken
but we're gonna try to get to the bottom
of it and explain what it means for
twitter how it came to be and sort of
what's what's gonna happen next here's
the photo i have to really sum it all up
i had to make this today you know i had
i had to move fast here elon musk bought
twitter so i got twitter and i got this
is production value baby listen like
almost all things that happen as
anything happens instantly whether you
like it or not immediately becomes
something that like determines your
political party
instantly i'm gonna try to zoom out from
that and approach it from a business
perspective but there was a lot of
political base takes mostly because
conservatives believe it will herald a
return of conservative voices like
donald trump to the platform and
democrats don't like that and some also
don't like it for monopoly reasons which
is that he is an extremely well he's the
wealthiest individual on earth buying a
media company but what i think was a
very very good take that sort of summed
it all up for me was the following
world's biggest clown perches world's
largest circus and i'm gonna try to
theme everything we talk about today
into this subject because here's the
deal twitter is not a good company and
needs a change
so you might think i might be against
this for monopoly reasons but i'm really
not but before we get into all my takes
on it let's do a quick disclosure on
some of the facts the deal is worth 44
billion dollars he's buying the company
about
54.20 a share and here's the disclosure
i own about 800 shares of twitter that i
acquired between 35 and 42. in 2020. so
i stand to make about i don't know like
10 grand on this which means uh
the immediate upside is good for me
let's look at what happened this is
twitter stock
elon musk nazis is interested straight
up and it's going to go up even higher
here 54. do i am if anything i am biased
financially towards this sale happening
and that that gives me an interesting
point of view because i want to talk to
you about sort of what led to this
moment you guys probably heard a lot of
terms like poison pill and yadda yadda i
can give you a quick breakdown on how we
got to this moment uh twitter has been
running for a very long time and it has
made almost no money if you go to the
max twitter basically has been i mean
look this is the peak is rather it
launched ipod in 2014 it took seven
years to go nowhere and ended up lower
than that twitter has made no progress
while even facebook and snapchat and
tick tock continue to bring in massive
revenue facebook while you know it's
starting to stagnate a little bit still
a thousand x bigger tick tock growing
rapidly snapchat growing rapidly twitter
has maintained a small amount of daily
active users the entire time barely
growing so overall twitter's been a
pretty mismanaged and bad company just
not good and part of that was due to the
previous ceo jack being a part-time ceo
he basically worked like four hours a
week on twitter didn't care there was no
progress i myself have visited twitter
headquarters and i was stunned it's a
very nice building in in like the heart
of downtown san francisco you know
really expensive real estate so back in
2014 i tweeted lunch at twitter and the
utensils or hashtag team
spoon for life anyway it's a very very
[ __ ] nice headquarters and i always
wondered like this entire building it's
like you know 12 stories massive
building really nice building all these
people are engineers almost all
engineers what the [ __ ] are they working
on
i remember saying that when i left
because twitter has not changed as a
product at all in like seven years i
mean almost nothing has changed what did
they they went from 140 characters to
240 they didn't add any other buttons
they don't do anything what the [ __ ] are
these people working on i've always
wondered that and then when this deal
came out this 43 billion deal i looked
into it and i wanted to see some more
hard numbers and what i found out is
they have i mean not only expensive
employee salaries but they have this
they have an r d budget that is almost
equivalent to tesla they spend 625
million dollars a year on r d what are
they are indeed what is their research
and development at twitter what is their
[ __ ]
what is this money going to when they
hired the new ceo they got rid of jack
jack stepped down it was their old ceo
the founder and they got a new ceo who
promised to make some changes and and uh
sort of get twitter on the right track
and all that i really think he added was
nft profile pictures so overall you can
say with quite confidence that twitter
management has been underperforming they
also made what could be called one of
the worst the single worst social media
business decision of all time which is
the shutdown vine this might be the
single dumbest thing that any company
has done in all of social media ever the
whole thing is it's actually crazy that
they didn't even like try to fix it they
literally shut it down i want to set the
stage with that because i want you to
know that like even if you are um not a
fan of elon musk and i'm not i think
he's i think he's generally a clown that
being said and even though i've ragged
on tesla's stock price before because i
think it's crazy high tesla is a good
company so as opposed to what's happened
at twitter which has been disaster after
disaster just years of uh flatlining
with that in mind my initial
gut reaction to this is that i'm
positive because it can't get worse
you know twitter is a [ __ ] show and
what's what's telling is when you read
the reactions from either side nobody
will say like i love twitter the way it
was
nobody's like twitter's so perfect now
don't change it now let me talk about
some of the upsides and downsides so the
only reason there are basically two
reasons that the board of twitter would
not want to accept his deal because you
know this is this is all about money at
the end of the day and if you're worth
this much and someone offers you way
more you should generally take it right
but the board was was as you guys have
probably seen the board of twitter has
been fighting um to stop elon from
taking over and you're probably
wondering why because it's worth a lot
more money and there's two reasons one
is that you think the management is
doing such a good job that this will
naturally go up back up even higher than
what elon was going to offer that you
think they'll get back to these heights
and more even though these were kind of
bubble fueled heights generally if you
ask around twitter shareholders nobody
believes that the other reason is that
the management of twitter wants to keep
their job
they're afraid that if elon musk moves
in he will fire some or all of them and
they like their cushy position they want
to keep it that is more likely and that
seemed to be the reason they were
fighting tooth and nail to stop his
takeover what percent of the companies
he owned he now owns 100 uh he owned
nine percent and their first step to
stopping him the ceo had a pretty smart
idea he went to elon and he said look
we'll let you go up to 15 we'll make you
a seat on our board the board of
directors decide what's what happens in
the company um but you have to cap your
amount of shares at 15 and he agreed and
then the day it was set to happen the
morning it was set to happen he backed
out and he said nah i'm gonna buy the
whole company and then they started to
fight him with the poison pill the
poison pill is a rule emergency backup
plan that a board can create i'm trying
to keep it simple if uh one shareholder
attempts to buy more than a certain
amount of a company it basically starts
printing a bunch of new shares it
dilutes the amounts of shares there are
so that they don't need to keep buying
new shares and it basically stops them
from being able to do it to make it
simple if he tried to buy 50 of the
company and there was a million shares
or whatever they would print two million
more that's the thing that's what
happened it would make it very
financially impossible to even know what
you had to spend and to get ready to buy
it poison pill would stop him taking
over when they announced that obviously
people got a little concerned because uh
the only reason to do that was be if you
thought the company's being run super
well and that elon must take over would
would not be good for the financial and
so they started to get lawsuits to brew
now most of these i think were
politically motivated there's a lot of
like conservative congressmen who just
think that elon musk coming to twitter
is going to be the greatest thing ever
for republican politics i don't maybe
maybe not but they're really diehard
about it and so a lot of like
republicans in congress were getting
ready to sue twitter for not doing their
fiduciary duty uh shareholders and so
with all that brewing i think twitter
decided last second to be like [ __ ] this
we don't want to be in protected
lawsuits elon musk is offering us an out
of a lot of money let's just take the
[ __ ] money and run let's just let's
just do it let's just get out and so
today they announced they're they're
conceding another part of it is this in
the past week as elon musk has been
talking about whether or not he's gonna
take over twitter there has been a lot
of people a lot of big banks a lot of
other people that are interested in
acquiring has been looking very closely
at twitter's financials to see how much
is this company actually worth they've
been looking at it internally to make
their case if they should get elon musk
in or not and when you look really
closely at twitter's financials start to
realize this company is already
overvalued
at 30 this company ain't worth [ __ ] it
lost 200 million dollars last year it
lost money it is a company that puts up
text
and sells ads on it and it lost 200
million dollars last year it didn't make
any profit at all revenue-wise it makes
about 3.4 billion dollars a year that's
what olive garden makes twitter is
literally the same revenue as olive
garden which is worth substantially less
and by the way olive garden makes profit
i think we covered the main tanks now
let's get some more some so basically if
you understand so much so far it's that
twitter's been a [ __ ] company for a long
time with no real progress elon musk is
offering to pay way more than it's worth
they decided to take it that's the long
and short of it and now we have to
figure out where it's going and it's
gonna become very political very quickly
so there was this note that said trump
said he has no plans to rejoin twitter
even if elon musk reinstates his account
that was from today and you'd think oh
let's open a shot but let's look into it
a little bit more because
when you actually read his statements
and you realize that trump owns a
competing social platform called truth
social that he's trying to prop up even
though it is bleeding cash and in fact
lost like 20 of its value today when
this was announced you have to think
this is a very short-term answer because
he said i hope elon buys twitter because
he'll make improvements to it and he is
a good man but i'm going to be staying
on truth so he's already saying he's pro
elon elon's a good man he's going to
make things better i think more
realistically he is trying to get exit
on truth shut down truth make some money
i don't know offload more shares
whatever and then very obviously he'll
be back on twitter in no time especially
as things ramp up for the 2024 election
probably drafted up some bangers in the
past year
wait is he already back let's see did he
tweet no shot he said today he wasn't
coming back
he tweeted he tweeted at 309 pm thank
you elon musk oh it's it's it's fake you
[ __ ] it's fake
i got fooled by a pool ball seven
[Laughter]
anyway so that that's happening and will
likely happen he's almost certainly
coming back in some form or another
there's another major concern here
number one is the employee reactions so
one thing you got to do you got to
retain talent and so employer reactions
have ranged from celebration from
someone the crypto side who are
worshiping elon musk twitter has a big
crypto side then there's the employees
that are threatening to quit and uh
screaming and crying they're losing
their minds and then i think most of
them though fall into this camp and i
found a twitter employee that i think
sums up what most of them are thinking
can someone tell me if i'm rich or if
i'm fired
i think they're all just trying to
figure this out uh and for some it might
be both for some it might be both more
realistically the problem at twitter
stems from leadership rather than like
random rank and file employees i don't
think there's like a mass firing situat
in general it's going to come from like
direction i think twitter's had no
direction it's been very coasting
whatever direction he takes in mass
fires whatever he does you're gonna have
to attract and retain new talent and
make actual changes to the to the
program and so we'll see how that
undergoes jeff bezos came in with a take
if you get jeff bezos out of his
slumbering post amazon rocket ship
retirement to tweet about it then then
you know something's big and jeffy b
dropped an interesting take interesting
question he says basically about this
tweet talking about how tesla has a
second bigot market in china chinese
battery makers are major supply specials
evs did the chinese government just gain
a bit of leverage over the town square
the idea is that twitter is a town
square of public opinion it is where a
lot of news stories are broken it's a
powerful weapon and controlling the
narrative in many non-chinese countries
now jeff bezos is probably not the right
person to say this because amazon
has bowed to the same pressures
specifically they partnered with china's
propaganda arm and in fact when this
book a collection of speeches by xi
jinping was released in china on amazon
um
it got
one bad review and they demanded
that amazon
remove the review function altogether
which they did if elon musk thinks
because he's the world's richest man he
can tell china to piss off if beijing
ever starts leaning on him about twitter
he'll find out about how efficiently the
chinese state can gobble up that tesla
shanghai factory taking with it as much
ip as it can yeah 100 correct now let's
talk about uh what i think no one this
is actually the take that i think almost
no one's talking about that i think
is my final big concern so the amount of
money was 43 billion dollars and you
think okay elon musk is the richest man
in the world he can afford it he's got
260 billion or something like that but
he doesn't actually have 260 billion
dollars he has a few billion dollars and
he has a lot of tesla stock and if he
tried to cash out 40 billion dollars of
tesla stock it would tank tesla's price
so i was wondering how did he get this
money like how did he how did he get the
money to acquire where did this money
come from and it turns out the vast
majority of this is debt he is taking
out a lot of debt and i thought okay
what's the interest payment on this debt
and it turns out it's decently high now
i don't want to bore you with these
charts but uh it's basically five
separate loans from different companies
for 500 million 6.5 billion three
billion three billion 2.5 billion and it
all comes out to they're at different
interest rates some three percent
somewhat four percent something six
percent 10 all of this debt burden falls
on twitter's shoulders as a private
company and we're looking at
something like a two billion dollar
yearly interest payment just to pay the
debt for elon musk buying the company he
is gonna buy the company and immediately
saddle it with a 2 billion a year
interest payment now this company
already lost 200 million dollars last
year it's not even making profit my
biggest take on this whole situation is
not that you know
i don't whether remove all the politics
in the situation i think this is going
to fail primarily because twitter is not
a very good business to begin with and
elon musk has just saddled it with
a massive amount of debt
now
no someone said this is not the best
interest of the shareholders uh the
shareholders are out you understand the
shows are cashing out i'm a shareholder
but i will no longer be after he's going
to pay me if he said elon musk is buying
all of the shares he's buying my shares
this is just for him but as a company it
is no longer gonna
it's it already didn't make much sense
and it's gonna make even less sense when
so here's what i'm saying what it means
for the future there is a real chance
that five years from now twitter
has to
ipo again to make its money back or it
has to
you know what i'm saying this company
goes private and just starts bleeding
cash there is no way to
make it profitable at current rate of
growth so two things will happen one
elon musk will massively turn this
company around and massively increase
profitability he will find a way to make
this company make a lot more money now
number one way you can do that is
advertising you could find a way to get
more advertisers to show up and use
twitter possible although i think
advertisers will be scared because
twitter is going to become even more
filled with political fighting you know
which is like usually something
advertisers want to try to get away from
the other way
is the subscription route and that is
what's been talked about a lot is
they're going to find a way to make
basically people pay for a check mark
pay for verification maybe they pay for
twitter blue or something so far the
soft launch of twitter blue has been
pretty underwhelming and not a big
seller so it remains to be seen if that
will work but one of these has to work
now this guy i don't know if you guys
remember but a while back i talked about
how remember that tomato guy the guy who
said the secret to getting rich is you
plant three tomatoes for three dollars
and then take the seeds from those and
then plant them again until you get nine
tomatoes and then you take the seeds
from those and then get you get that and
until you have a billion tomatoes and
then you're a billionaire you sell those
for yeah that was his big [ __ ] plan
to get rich uh he has a take
he has a take on how elon musk can make
twitter very profitable very quickly
let's see what that is uh how elon musk
can make twitter very profitable very
quickly charge people one dollar per
month for every 1 000 followers they
have
scaling up to two dollars per month per
follower if over 100k followers want
millions of eyeballs on twitter want to
make money here pay up so this is his
plan by his logic i would have to pay 75
bucks a month for twitter
someone like slime would have to pay
like a hundred bucks a month a lot of it
to pay like a thousand
[Laughter]
thousand dollars a month for
twitter that sounds
good that sounds good but that is the
type of groundbreaking thinking that
elon musk is gonna have to turn to to
figure out how to make this company
somehow profitable and somehow get a
return on this massive amount of
debt-fueled money uh overall can he
afford it yes we'll see how the debt
holds up what will happen it can't get
much worse i think that remains to be
seen but as a company it's been holding
flat to declining for seven years maybe
he can turn it around and hopefully at
the very least he can use his ability to
attract engineering talent to find some
people that will actually add to the
product because it has changed nothing
uh but overall i think we have analyzed
this deeply enough for one day thanks
for watching that was my coverage of
today's announcement of elon musk's
purchase of twitter thanks again for
watching

NOOOOOOOOOOOO TONY! - YouTube
let's start with the wins and fails
starting with a major win for a group
that needs it more than anyone else
weird old white guys in politics
this twitter user sean uh used face app
to mash
all 50 democratic and republican centers
together to show you what an average
senator looks like this is what the
average republican senator looks like so
if you look like this you are quite
likely to get elected as a republican
senator so if you are a you are
literally red you can get voted red if
you have a little bit more of a toothier
smile
you can get elected as a democrat
because this is what the average
democratic senator looks like
anyway
i thought this is a fascinating
look at who runs america
okay here's the win if you want to make
some money buying tesla stock buying
twitter stock a great way to do it is
public.com
where you can get up to 300 free dollars
just from signing up with my code uh i
use public to trade stocks on my phone
it is an extremely clean easy to use app
it's awesome
it has all the functionality you know
and expect from any other
trading app that you might know except
with a bonus it actually is an ethical
business model public.com does not sell
information on your trades to hedge
funds uh you can follow people and see
what they're trading like if you wanted
to see what i'm looking at you can
follow my account on there you can
follow other influencers and it has a
cool like just information tab where you
can see a lot of cool uh updates so
overall i like it it also will pay any
it has zero fees on anything and if you
have a fee to transfer your stuff to the
app it will pay the fee for you it
covers literally everything uh overall
i'm really happy with it happy to have
you everybody support it happy they
support marketing monday and you get a
free stock for signing up so there's no
real reason to check it out last thing
it has fractional shares so if you want
to buy like buy something of amazon for
example amazon shares with three
thousand dollars very expensive you can
buy a percent of a share and it'll go up
and down at the same rate so you can buy
however much you want of how much you
want of any stock and they will let you
fractional share it which is awesome
overall cool app i think uh probably
recommend it and they've supported
marketing monday consistently so check
them out let's get on to the fails the
fail is everyone out there who is
working a quote-unquote job bad bobby am
i saying that right i only know where's
the catch me outside girl catch me
outside how about dawg
uh she started and only fans is it baby
i thought it was barbie i always thought
it was a play on barbie and she changed
it because you know how um cardi b used
to be bacardi b and then she got sued
and changed it to cardi b i literally
always thought this was bad barbie and
she changed it to be safe it's bad baby
well it's crazy all right well if i'm a
boomer
you are part of this problem because she
made 42 million dollars from april 1st
april 25th on only fans
yeah i'm sorry one year and sorry one
year one year one year that puts her
above like
major a-list movie talent that puts her
in the realm of like top athletes
the number of professions in the world
that get you 42 million dollars in a
year at 19 is like it's like zero i
can't even
i don't think like i don't know if like
justin bieber at 19 was making minecraft
streamer maybe
do you know what i'm saying i i don't
think so tommy in it maybe
i don't know i don't think so unless you
get a mixer deal like ninja or shroud no
one's making 42 million a year she is
earning more
this year
than the 2021 yearly salary of the ceo
of coca-cola the ceo of google the ceo
of ibm the ceo of wells fargo the ceo of
boeing the ceo of charter
no not combined not combined but still
let's give a win to everyone in the
world though you have the pleasure you
have the honor you have the privilege of
living in this timeline the timeline
where snoop dogg
posted this they're coming to attack
pops
champ smoke that blunt and chill we
ninjas fam he's fighting right clickers

how um
our favorite person in the world
mark zuckerberg has had a hard time
relating to people finally we can
humanize our billionaire again because
today he posted this very candid and
very human-looking selfie
if that didn't make me love meta before
now i do now i know it's a group of
folks that i could have a beer with dude
the reason they they pivoted to meta and
the reason they're going all in on
virtual reality and is a part of
zuckerberg's long-standing feud and
hatred of apple they don't like that
apple owns the rails that they operate
on zuckerberg's plan is to get ahead of
that for the future where he thinks that
vr will replace phones that's the plan
that's the idea to do that he is
following apple's playbook to the letter
and in fact today they announced that
meta will begin opening physical stores
like apple stores where you can try vr
yourself you know this could be a very
expensive waste of time or at the
beginning of a
long-term consumer pivot towards
thinking this stuff is actually cool
i don't know
well i have a i have a guess
my theory on this has always been that
mark zuckerberg will spend his entire
[ __ ] company's future in fortune to
slightly increase the speed that vr
becomes mainstream and then right as it
does apple's gonna come in with a better
version
of the headset and then take all their
market share anyway let me give you a
fail this is gonna be the saddest news
you've heard
not just all week but maybe your all
life
the chris pratt mario movie has been
delayed
there i said it [ __ ]
nintendo of america tweeted this is
miyamoto
this is like what a scam email starts
with by the way he doesn't he's not
fluent in english he speaks a little
english there's no there's absolutely no
way this is miyamoto you know what i'm
saying this is miyamoto after consulting
with chris son
my partner at illumination on the super
mario bros film we decided to move the
global release to spring 2023
my deepest apologies but i promise to be
well worth the wait spring 2023
with the way the world is the only good
thing in the world is going to be chris
pratt's mario
thank god we have that small taste and
let me hear it one more time it's a me
a mario that's not the voice you'll have
to wait to hear the boy this is my
favorite thing that a celebrity's ever
done
every single time i watch it makes me
laugh it's actually such a [ __ ]
hilarious it's like his whole [ __ ]
psyches pouring out anyway that's the
status news today let me give you the
final win and fail um
that is a win okay we'll end on a win
because i've hit you with a lot of fails
today we're gonna end on a win
my final win
goes to bold predictions people out
there who are willing to put their best
foot forward like tv investor jim cramer
who in january of 2022 revealed to all
the fans of his stock picking show
his
magnificent seven seven stocks that you
could rely on for the future netflix
peloton paypal square zoom roku and
tesla
and i admire his boldness even if
unfortunately
every one of those seven
is down horrendously
if you had invested your money in a
diverse mix of his magnificent seven at
the time he said it you would be down
about half of everything you own
in one year sometimes you're wrong
you're right
because you know what that was a while
ago and people get better they improve
with their craft you predict you guess
you check you get better that's why when
two days ago she said twitter's board
has no choice but to reject elon musk's
offer says jim cramer i knew
this legend was in for another win
which
actually brings us
to our men's story of the day
elon musk buying twitter
now
The "Everything Bubble" is Popping - YouTube
so this is probably not a this is not a
good thing to say but you know how for
like over a year now
i've been talking about how like
everything's in a bubble
and then like now
it's all popping it's all happening now
and so i have a lot i want to say on it
we hodling on doge
whoa
damn you love to see that from dosh
hoddle
by the dip by the dip everyone knows
that elon is going to take us to the
moon
here's the deal here's what we have to
do we're going to talk about everything
i'm going to change the title the
everything bubble is popping so um maybe
you've noticed
that
every single [ __ ] thing is down
netflix shopify carvana every single
thing is down
of the major tech stocks and
of course more than everything the mean
stocks everything is popping and you
might be wondering what's going on why
is the everything bubble popping why is
everything that was doing so good in
2021 suddenly all collectively falling
at once the
real cause here is the following
inflation is that all-time highs it's
it's spiking and not slowing down
because in 2020 and 2021 money was free
it was essentially free to borrow and so
everybody was borrowing money
to run businesses that didn't make that
much money and to invest in those
businesses and that can go for a long
time until inflation starts to get out
of control once that starts to get crazy
the government has only one tool at its
disposal really and that is to make it
more expensive to borrow money that's
called raising interest rates and when
that happens it is uh it's not a it's
not like a toothbrush you know what i'm
saying it's not a fine instrument it's a
sledgehammer
them just raising interest rates a
little bit and talking about raising
them more is what's caused everything to
start crashing at once and so like i
said i said this a few months ago in the
inflation video there's two outcomes and
that is uh recession
or rampant inflation and the actually
the third outcome is both
if they keep [ __ ] dilly dallying
we're gonna get [ __ ] stagflation and
we're gonna get both we're in a crazy
crazy time right now but the problem is
uh either inflation keeps going up and
everything keeps getting rampantly more
expensive or
they raise interest rates and the
everything bubble pops which is already
doing we need to get scapegoat there's
no scapegoat good enough and in history
you know when the [ __ ] like this happens
the party in power always loses when the
great recession happened in 2007 2009
the way that we got out of it was by
printing a bunch of money surprise
surprise it actually worked but it's
like you're feeling depressed so you
take meth dude you know what i'm saying
it worked because it was a it was a
short-term high and we got addicted to
it we got addicted to it and so instead
of tapering it off they actually kept
going and increased it this has all been
happening for years and years and years
and we've been enjoying it because it's
been leading to everything spike
businesses that don't really have a good
business plan can survive for a very
long time by continuing to raise more
money as long as you were growing
nobody really cared whether you were
making a solid profit whether you had a
solid fundamental business model
as long as you're growing and so that's
why companies like
peloton and zoom
airbnb and all these uber were worth
tens hundreds of billions of dollars and
they weren't even making money so to
avoid that the government had a
brilliant solution we're gonna stamp our
feet ah we're gonna raise interest rates
you better stop borrowing but they
didn't want to actually do it
they know that if they actually do it it
would lead to the bubble popping so they
were just saying it and it didn't really
work and then they raised it just a
little bit
and they're like we're gonna raise it
more and then inflation didn't stop and
but already just those two tiny bumps in
the interest rate have caused a lot of
things to implode
so it's kind of like we have a perfect
storm
of like four or five different things
that all individually cause recessions
or depressions
and they're all here at once
and the government just doesn't have the
tools
to do anything about it at this point
it's like it's too late so oh here's the
question you guys are asking a lot of
people are asking this and in fact i
know they're asking this because i can
look at the data people are asking
should i buy the dip a lot of people who
have been investing in the past let's
say 10 years have never seen a market
where stocks don't always go up people
are kind of under the impression that
stocks always go up that's not true at
all like sometimes things go down and
crash so and the point i'm trying to
make is that uh i looked at the data
and retail investors which is what you
and i are average people not hedge funds
or big
um
uh are our
all-time highs on buying stocks right
now you guys are out there buying
gamestop and you're buying
amc
and i'm trying to get the the chart um
people during this fall are spending
more than they ever have on buying
stocks this is already risky this is a
risky thing because
a lot of these companies are not good
let me show you an example peloton
is a company that was high-flying last
year now it's at twelve dollars but it's
basically down ninety percent people
might think they want to buy the dip but
let's look at this actual company
so this is a hilarious marked up balance
sheet that someone posted on twitter and
uh you can sort of see that their
revenue is collapsing you think it's a
good business right you take some
aluminum you make a [ __ ] bike you
sell it for way more than it costs to
make it's a decent business but the
problem is their margin is going down
every year so they used to make 35
profit on everything sold now it's down
to 19 percent and they're absolutely
burning cash so if you're ever looking
at a balance sheet probably the most
important thing to take a look at every
time is free cash flow if you see a
company that has positive free cash flow
that means not in parentheses you're
looking at a company that at the very
least makes sense it's it's like what
used to be the main metric for
businesses until this whole bubble
and uh these guys are burning
so
what is this 204 million
546 million last quarter
746 million this quarter so not only are
they burning cash they're burning more
cash as the time goes they're putting
more cash every quarter like it's
getting worse
and now owing a lot of money is really a
bad a very expensive prospect and people
don't want to invest in a company that
owes a lot of money has no plan to get
it back and burns the money every
quarter i i'm not an investing advisor
i'm not going to tell you that
something's going to go up or down
because nobody knows
i'm just telling you things that are
true right now and what the likely
outcome of that is
so so yeah uh people are bringing up
crypto and i think crypto is one of the
biggest um
targets of the everything bubble popping
it's going to be though it seems to be
the first wave
crypto is getting absolutely hammered
despite what this guy says
i wonder how many of these companies you
think are entering the space just
because it's hot and there's a lot of
funding versus the ones that will still
be here you know like 95 are gonna die
yeah 95 they're going to die yeah
there's also entertainment from watching
companies tattoo
there's entertainment oh man that's
that's that's so evil at least you get
to learn from it right yeah it is
entertaining especially when this guy's
company is down this guy's coin is down
90
there is some entertainment value in
that he was running luna which is what's
called a stable coin with the idea being
that it's tied to the us dollar and thus
is much more stable
but unfortunately all of these stable
coins quote unquote don't actually have
the monetary reserves to uh to back what
they say they're gonna do so it's all a
bunch of like financial trickery and
algorithm trickery that doesn't actually
work
when uh there's like massive crypto
outflows which there is and so these
devil coins are starting to um collapse
bitcoin messenger panicking i think
bitcoin went under 30k today
and uh it seems to be the first wave of
of of a larger financial reckoning
by the dip
i mean there's only one coin that i'm
buying the dip on
to the moon to the moon diamond hands
diamond you know what still performing
better than dogecoin
i understand why bad companies are going
down but why are good companies going
down the thing is great companies amazon
for example apple these are a phenomenal
company the problem is even graycomb in
fact especially great companies in a
time where money is free to borrow get
overvalued they get they get they get
ahead of themselves the point i always
make when i talk about tesla is that
tesla even if tesla is a great company
does that mean it is worth more than
every single other car company combined
no it doesn't make sense the valuation
is too high doesn't this car company
shouldn't be worth 1.1 trillion dollars
and as it turns out
when you can't borrow money infinitely
to buy calls on this stock uh it isn't
it's down 30
they're 40 year-to-date
how would a recession reset things so
listen in the short term recessions are
terrible they're just bad people die
people lose their houses people are
fired there's nothing good about a
recession i can't tell you about that
it's in the short term but in the long
term a recession can be a reset that
allows things to be bought at more
reasonable levels as real investments
like a more real-world example is think
of like um let's say you're a new
restaurant owner let's say you're a
young startup person you can buy that
you can buy the grill in the kitchen for
cheap you can start investing and
building your own business for cheap and
you start to see new growth and
innovation things start to build it's
like clearing the underbrush out of a
forest it's like a controlled demolition
you know what i'm saying here's a great
example actually more recently because
i've been looking into this myself for
the longest time it's been considered
that um you know how we all moved to
shopping online the idea was that uh
why would you pay rent in a mall when
you could set up your business online
and sell direct but it turns out over
the past few years as it's become more
and more popular there's more
competition in that area the rents you
have to pay online are almost equaling
or exceeding what you have to play
offline and so recently because there's
been a collapse in malls
you can actually set up a business in a
mall for no rent at all and they just
get a cut of your revenue like right now
you can go to a popular mall and there's
a decent chance you can get literal
store space for no rent and they just
get cut of your revenue which is going
to lead to innovation a recession allows
for change that is the upside in the
longer term what if we take over canada
and then sell it back to them to make
some money
now we're thinking canada what would you
pay for your own country
we'll give you drake
we'll take drake but you have to take
jack harlow
uh anyway so that's the everything
bubble i'm sorry that i'm i'm um there's
i mean there's more i can say on
uh what about the good news well the
good news is that i'm probably gonna
play a little balloon later tonight
you
The Cringiest Layoff Ever - YouTube
welcome to marketing monday wins and
fails edition let's get right into it
we're back it's been like three weeks
and we're gonna kick off with a win on
finding a great deal it's hard with how
overvalued
everything every asset has been in the
past two years it's been hard to find a
great deal nobody can get a good house
at a good price anymore but thankfully
i've found one and who can jump on this
quickly hopefully one of you and
unoccupied house on stilts in north
carolina a cool 381 thousand dollars
according to zillow
let's get a quick footage of it
it's a house and a boat
that should be worth more i love a good
fixer-upper
you don't get more oceanfront than that
you get the ocean right at your door
again we're a unique spot for housing
prizes where despite the fact that
everything else is sort of popping tech
stocks crypto housing has maintained
generally it's elevated prices due to a
couple reasons that we'll see how they
hold but at least we can think about one
thing we can say one thing and be happy
at least we're not
canada
because canada's housing prices are
twice as bad and getting worse at least
you can make your money back by
getting in on this brand new trend this
is absolutely a win for my man mark
zuckerberg who is never late to the
party okay because he announced today
nfts are coming to instagram
yes right on time this is right when the
nft
craze is about to hit its peak and i
think it's what everyone's been asking
for over instagram they're like hey tick
tock is starting to eat our lunch what
do we need what's going to get our users
back and get them back on instagram nfts
baby and let's ignore the fail of this
false data that says there's an nft
market route weekly sales down 64
every nft collection taking a beating
look at all this fake news dude that
mark zuckerberg carefully ignored in
order to get his engineers working on an
nft solution for instagram really
appreciate his perseverance right on
time king speaking of bored apes i want
to give a third win to the lost art
of laying people off with dignity when
you're a manager an executive you have
to make layoffs it's tough today has
been a brutal day at the office i made
the painful decision to let go of 87
beloved members of the cameo family
you cannot say can't heal fameo as you
fire people
while huddling your hexagonal board ape
avatar nobody who got fired by you wants
to see this but you know what i thought
about it more and it really is a win
because his employees who are now down
financially because they don't have a
job can at least know
that he shares in their pain and is also
down financially
after spending 300 grand plus on this
nft which will not sell for anywhere
near that amount uh but speaking of uh
crypto nfts they're all down but if you
did want to consider getting involved in
investing and perhaps more safer stocks
or maybe you just want to test your
brain and invest small fractional parts
of money just to see how things would do
perhaps i would check out public the
sponsor for today's marketing monday i
literally use this app every day to
check my stocks it's extremely clean
it's easy to use it's got a great
interface it has easy access information
and it's all included in the app you can
follow investors if you want to see what
they post you can follow me on there you
can follow cody co or scott galloway or
it does not have an unethical business
model that requires them to sell
information on your trades to hedge
funds i independently reviewed it myself
before i accept this sponsorship it
literally is true they literally have an
actual ethical business model but what i
would say is a cool thing you can do
because people like to think about what
they'd invest in is you could do
fractional shares like if you could if
you want to buy like 0.01 of an amazon
share for a dollar you can do that and
then see how what percentage goes up and
down so you can like almost do like a
test bet and like test your theories
over over six months to a year and just
see like what would happen check it out
thanks to the public for sponsoring back
to the wins and fails but big win to
public let's go to a fail now that of
course one man who let the real famio
down that's justin lin former director
of fast10 who reportedly quit his
directing job of fast tin because of a
perfect man vin diesel he claimed that
diesel always shows up late to the set
doesn't know his lines and he shows up
out of shape what about family justin
lin and what's crazy is if you look more
into this he is giving up between 10 and
20 million dollars just to not work with
vin diesel
do you know how bad that has to be
people do not like to work with vin
diesel for some reason and it's very odd
and so i found this video proving that
vin diesel is absolutely a treat to work
with this is from vin diesel's instagram
story the day before justin lin quit and
it's like how could you possibly see
this coming because he seemed so so um
having so much fun the whole time what
do you think justin
week one just finished week one
is it fair to say that this will be the
best one
in my heart yes
wow you can just tell that he was not a
hostage at all obviously fast 10 must go
on is the movie event of the
millennium and so director
louis le terrier is going to be
replacing justin lin who you probably
don't know by face or name
but he did create magician movie
now you see me
which famously has quote unquote
magicians
performing actual magic it might
actually be good because that kind of
cheesy over-the-top energy that now you
see me has is kind of the perfect energy
for fast fast and the furious so i'm
actually not opposed to it you guys know
that in the past decade the big trend in
the world of gaming has been towards
live service games games that are
constantly being updated live you can
play them forever and they keep adding
new patches and skins apex legends lives
fortnite live service games the problem
with those games is that there's too
many players you know there's so many
millions people playing fortnite that
when they make an update or a new skin
it could be for anybody maybe i want
skins that are tailored towards me
that's why i want to shout out the
heroes
over at babylon's fall a game that had
exactly one player this game just
launched and is already down to exactly
one player on a live service game it is
the first live service game that i have
seen
where the staff working on it outnumber
the player base significantly that means
this guy has skin artists uh game
directors programmers
uh an entire team of people working to
make his or her experience better that's
powerful this is of course from square
enix and platinum games by the way
square enix squaring is selling all of
its western assets including tomb raider
deus ex for like fire sale prices of 200
million dollars they have literally just
said [ __ ] it we are completely out they
did to invest in crypto not a joke i
actually didn't hear that is that true
square enix sold tomb raider for magic
crypto beans
i did oh my god this is a live wins and
fail
well i i knew they had sold i did not
know glaring excels tomb raider to bet
big on the blockchain yeah they did it
right before the crash
and they saw dude they sold tomb raider
and deus ex for phenomenally cheap to
get nfts that's so crazy i want to give
a win here you know how like in in uh
movies and film there will often be like
a a faded prophecy that that someone
will tell someone and then when they try
to stop that prophecy from happening
they create it well that is happening
right now with the video game star field
which is worried that the game will
become the next cyberpunk
so to avoid that they're announcing
massive delays
[Laughter]
bro i've seen this story before i know
what's happening the only difference
between this situation starfield which
was one of the most hyped games this
year's recently announced been delayed
to next year is that cyberpunk's
developer steve project red had a good
reputation going into it this is
bethesda dude everyone already expects
this game to have a buggy launch now
it's gonna be a delayed
crunched i'm sure
still buggy launch and you know what yes
i'm saying how buggy does the game have
to be if bethesda delayed it because
they think it's too buggy
but thursday has shipped so many buggy
games how [ __ ] bad does this one have
to be if they were like we can't
we actually can't let's give a uh
surprising first of the year failed xbox
and a surprising first of the year dub
to sony really it feels like the entire
narrative at least in the west for the
first half of the year has been like
xbox firing on all cylinders
but with both
red fall and starfield a big exclusive
they paid a lot of money for they paid
many many billions to acquire bethesda
like 9 billion and they don't have a
game this year it's making 2022 seem a
little bit worse for the xbox side combo
that with a dub on the sony side which
just announced their new ps plus lineup
to compete with um game pass and it's
actually pretty good they do have a
decent um game pass competitor that is
improving rapidly because they see the
future of the market so
like i said way back in my first video
on this console war as long as the
competition remains fierce between
microsoft and sony the real winner will
be the gamers both sides are getting
better both sides are getting better
games pc gamers are winning most of all
because they both have to put their
games on pc to make a profit this
competition is awesome the second one of
them wins it's gonna be miserable so we
really have to hope that
the war continues as long as it can
because we're getting a lot of great uh
improvements and innovation
while the war is in full swing you know
what i'm going to be honest with this
one usually if i flip it if you don't if
you've learned my amazing joke where if
it's a win i'll say a fail if it's a
fail i'll say a win i'm going to give an
actual fail to what elon musk the trend
he has started because jeff bezos is now
a twitter [ __ ] poster
he's coming out
unhinged and he launched today with some
uh all-out attacks on the administration
uh the biden administration for their
role in inflation and for suggesting
that the wealthiest individuals on earth
should pay more taxes
he really didn't like that part it's
pretty well established that raising
taxes especially progressive taxes that
are increasing the wealthy is actually
one of the best tools to combat
inflation but i don't think that he is
interested in that solution i think he
mostly wants to talk about
people getting checks back during the
pandemic in 2020 2021 and he wants to
call that the only cause of inflation
and there is no solution now but he's
still he's still not yet a meme posting
phase we'll see if he gets there soon i
want to do it wins and fails like i've
been talking about for a while on what's
going on in the state of unions the
state of the union on unions uh
regularly i give wins and fails updates
on what's going on with unions and for
the past few months i've been given win
after win after win okay there's been
progress with the amazon union progress
with the starbucks union progress with
tons of views in fact i'll give a win
right now the target union is just
launched
employees in a store in virginia just
ratified their union contracts and they
are now having a target union it's
awesome there's actual union progress
which is leading to uh you know better
worker protections higher wages um less
corporate control they're not taking 99
of the profit it's good this is all
actually an awesome thing and good for
workers rights but
we live in a pendulum-based
society here and when things tilt
towards the winds eventually it comes
back and i do want to say
we are due for the empire striking back
here this past week has been a lot of
news about all of the tactics that these
big corporations are now using to fight
back extra hard against the unions
they've now gotten spooked at the
progress unions are making and they are
literally focusing insane efforts for
example starbucks just announced an
illegal
wage increase that would only apply to
non-unionized workers basically saying
if you join the union you won't get a
raise by the way this is illegal but
they are doing it to scare more stores
into not doing it it's literally not
allowed it has been already like uh shot
down sort of quote-unquote but they are
publicizing it all over to try and scare
stores into not joining the union again
as long as they can get their message
out stronger than like the counter
argument they can scare enough employees
away from ratifying union contracts in
all these different stores starbucks
union workers are actually starting to
make real progress
on the other hand a more scary enemy
is amazon so i mentioned recently that
amazon had a very big union win recently
it was the first one to make any
progress against the monolith that is
amazon and amazon immediately fired back
amazon went and fired every single
senior manager who worked at that
warehouse for losing the battle to the
union sending a clear message to every
single one of their other managers that
if you don't do something to stop units
at your plant
you'll get fired which encourages them
to do anything illegal even and
their pressures continue their lobbying
is continued and the second labor vote
at staten island was a loss for the
amazon labor union so they couldn't even
repeat their victory for their second
warehouse they only got one warehouse we
will see how it plays out i'm i'm i'm
hoping and praying that the fight
continues and then amazon labor unions
continue their uh continuing progress
but i just want you to know that like
the empire is striking back here i have
two quick updates that'll close out the
wins and fail show number one
i'd like you all
to say a farewell
to the ipod it may not have mean
something to you
but it meant something to me okay after
22 years the final ipod has been created
it's been completely shut down the last
factory closed there is no more ipods
this was really a breakthrough pro i'm
not an apple show i don't even have an
iphone but the ipod was a product that
literally turned around a dying company
apple was a dying small company
basically kept afloat by microsoft who
was giving them money every year to use
office so that they could say they had
competition literally apple was being
kept afloat so that microsoft could go
to court and say they had competition uh
and now they are the biggest company in
the world three trillion dollars plus
and it began with this turnaround from
this ipod this product was a consumer um
electronics revolution the marketing was
incredibly good 1000 songs in your
pocket is one of the best taglines of
all time
it was basically genius and because i
wanted to give a fun piece of honor for
it and also shout out to the boomers in
chat who had an original ipod i found
this video of a girl getting an ipod for
christmas in 2002.
a cd player
i really don't know what it is
i don't get it so every cd you guys own
between the two of you now can go on
each one of those it can yes
anytime you want any place you are
it's like a walkman it's called the ipod
okay explain it a little further
they were not getting it
and that's within 20 years it yeah it
always makes me think i i really like
that video because it made me think like
how much [ __ ] has changed in oh you know
only two decades you can imagine what
shit's gonna be like in 2040. you're
just gonna be [ __ ] wild the only
reason that apple got into the iphone
again steve jobs initially was like
we'll just keep making ipods ipods are
great don't distract the core business
of ipods they got into the iphone
because they started looking around at
the market and realizing that some of
the other phone players were starting to
add music functionality to phones music
on phones starting to get a thing
they're like wait a minute if this keeps
going people aren't gonna carry two
devices they're gonna carry either a
phone or an ipod if this keeps going
they'll just put all their music on
their phone and we're going to kill our
ipod business which is our biggest thing
we have to get ahead of that and so
actually their first solution was to
partner with motorola and they created
what was called the itunes phone which
is where motorola would have the phone
but it would have built in itunes
functionality and if you ever want to
watch it it only has like 5 000 views 10
000 views it's one of the funniest
keynote speeches steve jobs has ever
done because you can tell that he
[ __ ] hates it
steve jobs has never been less enthused
in his entire life he hates the product
design he tries to use it as a tech demo
it fails he presses the wrong button
because there's too many you know it's
complicated then he brings up the
motorola guy who is an awful presenter
anyway the whole time you could tell
that steve jobs was very unhappy with
his partnership and it was after this
keynote they decided to start making
their own phone which led to the iphone
let me show you with the final win and
fail in a new segment my brand new wins
and fills up that it's not a win or a
fail at all it is what i call what's up
beijing of course intro by premier xi
himself
was that beijing
thank you for the intro let's get
into it uh what's up vision where i'm
gonna give you a little bit of a china
update a random person with the last
name ma was detained by chinese police
and alibaba lost 26 billion dollars in
value because everyone was scared that
it was jack ma
the ceo of alibaba it wasn't 26 billion
dollars in value was lost instantly
because the investors were so panicked
that jack ma might have gotten arrested
it's actually so crazy how on edge every
investor there is at any government
action it's the amount of control they
have over the market is is insane and as
an alibaba investor wow i was so happy
that
a company i invested in lost 26 billion
dollars in value in a day
so that was one big update and i'm gonna
give one more and that is so uh if you
guys don't know china's continuing its
covet zero strategy which has draconian
crazy insane levels of lockdowns across
major cities the most impacted being
shanghai and they are now starting to
pay a serious price for it their economy
is slowing rapidly because literally
factories can't run trucks can't move
everything is so shut down that it's
actually causing a severe crunch so it's
really it's uh it's a no-win situation
but i wanted to give a quick update on
china i want to get into the main story
of the wins and fails this is we're
gonna this is a new segment where i do a
deeper dive okay
[Music]
What Happened to FaZe's Billion? - YouTube
this is we're gonna this is a new
segment where i do a deeper dive this
was gonna be its own video but
unfortunately i got scooped by ludwig
who took my thumbnail and title but
didn't do the same video i want to talk
to you this is both a win and a feel
this is like a new segment it's a win
and fail combined ultimate deep dive
this is about face clan i want to talk
about face clan now if you guys don't
know libby did a video called face clan
is going bankrupt and then he talked
about a face clan show that's not doing
well which is an interesting subject
that's interesting subject but it's not
anything to do with the real story here
which is that face clan might actually
be going bankrupt
let's talk about it but first let me
tell you the story so let's give a win
in the past i don't know if you guys
remember late last year faze clan
announced the following they were going
public at a 1 billion dollar valuation
and their board of directors would
include snoop dogg they were gonna be
the first billion dollar esports company
they were gonna be publicly listed on
the nasdaq you could go into your app
and trade phase stock that was the plan
that was the plan they announced late
last year they were into a thing called
a spec because uh taking a private
company public especially one that's not
really well established like face is
actually very long slow expensive
process but for a while during the 2020s
and 2021 years there was this uh tool
called a spec a special purpose
acquisition corporation which is where a
company is already listed and they just
merge with you and then you take the
name so it would be a boring company
called like yeah b riley principal 150
merger corp this company's already
listed publicly so they just merge with
phase clan and become face clan and that
way you can skip all the red tape and
instantly go public and that was their
like roundabout way using spax to go
public and spax had a big boom last year
a bunch of companies were skipping the
process going public making a bunch of
money from investors who thought stocks
only went up right about now in 2022 the
story is different spacks are basically
all imploding almost every spec that
went public in the past two years is
down 80 90 percent and everyone that
invested in them lost money so nobody
wants to do it again so
instead of being public right now like
they said they'd be in fact things are
much more dire they were valued at a
billion dollars they had a bunch of
articles they had a bunch of publishing
they were valued at 1 billion these are
all the news articles that went out
unfortunately none of it turned out to
be true so now
they had to release a financial forecast
because they weren't public in time and
the financial forecast is much much
darker than they originally promised
they still have income they don't
actually make money because they spend
more than they make they made i think
around something like 50 million dollars
income 52 million dollars in revenue
which was awesome but unfortunately they
actually recorded a loss of 28 million
so they spent about 80 million they made
50 million but for some reason spent 80.
i don't know what phase faceclion is
spending 80 million dollars on but they
are losing money and so naturally a
company that only makes 50 million in
revenue and then loses 80 million on
that is not a business worth one billion
dollars
i know in 2021 that'd be a crazy thing
to say but i think in 2022 we can say
that a company that doesn't even make
that much money and then loses all of it
and more is not a billion dollar
business that everyone wants to buy
stock in it's not and so this this
financial update has really cast doubts
on their ability to get the deal through
which is bad because they were relying
on some of the cash that was in that
boring company when they merged they get
the cashes in the boring company and
that boring company had like 70 million
dollars in cash reserves they were gonna
get access to when they when they
acquired instead they're not gonna get
that it means they cannot pay their
bills which means they're at very real
risk of actual actual bankruptcy unless
they acquire new funding soon they can't
continue to lose millions of dollars a
month and not get this merger faze clan
while they still have some they have
sponsorship income and if they were able
to cut costs they could survive but if
they don't cut costs and they don't find
new funding faze clan will actually go
bankrupt they're they're on the way to
doing that very quickly because of this
deal falling through unless they find a
way to um do it now even if the deal
goes through there is no shot it's worth
a billion dollars even at their crazy
outlandish numbers even if using their
extreme expectations it's still valued
only at 650 million now so they've lost
400 million dollars in values even on
their crazy expectations so there's just
no way that story about them becoming
the first billionaire resource company
is anywhere close to true and if this
deal doesn't go through it at all it may
just be bank or they just be gone the
big question here is what are they
spending the money on how are they
spending 80 million dollars and i looked
into it and there's a lot of stuff i
mean they're spending on the face house
they have expensive rent they have
expensive talent agreements but one
thing that was very interesting to me is
that they have extremely high executive
compensation their ceo gets paid 1.38
million dollars which is a big chunk of
what the company makes that's a very
very high salary for a ceo that is more
salary than like
many many bigger companies ceos it's
actually uh it's it's very high for the
size of company they are and more
crazily they hired a chief strategy
officer named kai henry who makes a
whopping 3 million dollars in salary per
year more than there's three times more
than ceo and i was like who the hell is
their chief strategy officer kai i've
never heard of this guy how important
could be this this guy be then he gets
paid 3 million dollars in salary so i
looked up kai henry and what do i see
but aboard a profile picture on
instagram it all comes full circle it
all comes back this guy with 7
818 followers is apparently worth three
million dollars a year to face a company
that is losing money hand over fist
[Laughter]
what exactly is going on
but at least they got snoop though
so i'm interested and i will be
following up on this story of face
clan's possible implosion but let's just
say all things are not phased up
over there some things are face down
like their revenue
like their profit like their chances of
survival uh and we'll have to see but
anyway that's my that's my mini deep
dive on the world of phase i did do some
looking at their balance sheet and it is
a shocking story and i would not uh
recommend investigations
